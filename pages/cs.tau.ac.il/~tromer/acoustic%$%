    Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration
    in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more
    than a nuisance: they can convey information about the software running on
    the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive information about
    security-related computations. In a <a href="ec04rump/">preliminary
      presentation</a>, we have shown that different RSA keys induce different
    sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits. The
    main problem was the very low bandwidth of the acoustic side channel (under
    20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound
    microphones), many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of
    the attacked computers.<br>
    <br>
    Here, we describe a new <em>acoustic cryptanalysis</em> key extraction
    attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can
    extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various
    models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during
    the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate
    that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone
    placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters
    away.<br>
    <br>
    Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack can be
    performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer chassis. A
    suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target computer with his
    bare hand, or get the required leakage information from the ground wires at
    the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet cables.<br>

    <h2>Q&amp;A<br>
    </h2>
    <h3> Q1: What information is leaked?</h3>
    <h3><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></h3>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>This depends on the specific
    computer hardware. We have tested numerous laptops, and several desktops.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>In&nbsp;almost all machines, it is possible to distinguish an idle CPU
        (x86 "HLT") from a busy CPU.</li>
      <li>On many machines, it is moreover possible to distinguish different
        patterns of CPU operations and different programs. </li>
      <li>Using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> as our study case, we
        can, on some machines:
        <ul>
          <li>distinguish between the acoustic signature of different RSA secret
            keys (signing or decryption), and</li>
          <li>fully extract decryption keys, by measuring the sound the machine
            makes during decryption of chosen ciphertexts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Q2: What is making the noise?</h3>
    The acoustic signal of interest is generated by vibration of electronic
    components (capacitors and coils) in the voltage regulation circuit, as it
    struggles to supply constant voltage to the CPU despite the large
    fluctuations in power consumption caused by different patterns of CPU
    operations. The relevant signal is <em>not</em> caused by mechanical
    components such as the fan or hard disk, nor by the laptop's internal
    speaker. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
    </span>
    <h3> <a name="Q-mobile"></a>Q3: Does the attack require special equipment?</h3>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>It sure helps, and in the <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/new.html#paper">paper</a>
    we describe an expensive hardware setup for getting the best sensitivity and
    frequency response. But in some cases, a regular mobile phone is good
    enough. We have used a mobile phone to acoustically extract keys from a
    laptop at a distance of 30cm, as in the following picture.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 455px; height: 245px;" alt="mobile phone attack"
        src="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/img/resized_mobile-attack.jpg"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3> Q4: What is the acoustic attack range?<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
          style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>That
    depends on many factors. Using a sensitive parabolic microphone, we
    surpassed 4 meters. In the following example, a parabolic microphone,
    attached to a padded case of equipment (power supply, amplifier, filters,
    and a laptop running the attack code) is extracting an RSA key from a target
    laptop (on the far side of the room).<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 700px; height: 367px;" alt="parabolic mic attack in classroom"
        src="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/img/web_classroom.jpg"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    Without the ungainly parabolic dish, we achieved a range of 1 meter. In the
    following, the target (A) is on the right, and the attacker is on the left.
    Only the capsule of the microphone, marked (B), is sensitive to position and
    orientation; the rest of the attacker's equipment can be hidden away.<br>

    <h3> <a name="scenarios"></a>Q5: What are some examples of attack
      scenarios?</h3>

    </div>
    We discuss some prospective attacks in our <a href="#paper">paper</a>. In a
    nutshell:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Install an attack app on your phone. Set up a meeting with the victim
        and place the phone on the desk next to his laptop (see <a href="#Q-mobile">Q2</a>).</li>
      <li>Break into the victim's phone, install the attack app, and wait until
        the victim inadvertently places his phone next to the target laptop.</li>
      <li>Construct a web page use the microphone of the computer running the
        browser (using Flash or HTML Media Capture, under some excuse such as
        VoIP chat). When the user permits the microphone access, use it to steal
        the user's secret key.</li>
      <li>Put your stash of eavesdropping bugs and laser microphones to a new
        use.</li>
      <li>Send your server to a colocation facility, with a good microphone
        inside the box, and then acoustically extract keys from all nearby
        servers.</li>
      <li>Get near a TEMPEST/1-92 protected machine, such as the <a href="http://www.advprograms.com/pdfs/105_Workstation_Specs.pdf">one</a>
        pictured to the right, place a microphone next to its ventilation holes,
        and extract its supposedly-protected secrets.</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>
    <h3> Q6: What if I don't have any microphone, or the environment is too
      noisy?<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
    Another low-bandwidth channel is the electric potential of the laptop's
    chassis. We've shown that in many computers, this "ground" potential
    fluctuates (even when connected to a grounded power supply) and leaks the
    requisite signal. This can be measured in several ways, for example:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Magic-touch</em> attack:&nbsp; the attacker measures the chassis
        potential by merely touching the laptop chassis with his hand, while
        surreptitiously measuring his own body potential relative to the ground
        potential of the room. (This attack is especially effective in hot
        weather, since sweaty fingers offer a lower electric resistance.)</li>
      <li><em>Far-end-of-cable</em> attack: the victim plugs in some
        innocuous-looking VGA or Ethernet cable into his laptop. The attacker
        measures the shield's electric potential on the far side of the cable
        (out of sight, in some cabinet or server room).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Q7: Can an attacker use power analysis instead?</h3>
    <p>Yes, power analysis (by measuring the current drawn from the laptop's DC
      power supply) is another way to perform our low-bandwidth attack. </p>
    <p>If the attacker can measure clockrate-scale (GHz) power leakage, then
      traditional power analysis may also be very effective, and far faster.
      However, this&nbsp;is foiled by the common practice of filtering out high
      frequencies on the power supply.</p>
    <h3><a name="kHz-GHz"></a>Q8: How can low-frequency (kHz) acoustic leakage
      provide useful information about a much faster (GHz)</h3>
    Individual CPU operations are too fast for a microphone to pick up, but long
    operations (e.g., modular exponentiation in RSA) can create a characteristic
    (and detectable) acoustic spectral signature over many milliseconds. In the
    chosen-ciphertext key extraction attack, we carefully craft the inputs to
    RSA decryption in order to maximize the dependence of the spectral signature
    on the secret key bits. See also <a href="#bit-extract">Q18</a>.
    <h3><a name="Q-GnuPG"></a>Q9: How vulnerable is GnuPG now? </h3>
    We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4576">CVE-2013-4576</a>,
    suggested suitable countermeasures, and worked with the developers to test
    them. New versions of GnuPG 1.x and of libgcrypt (which underlies GnuPG
    2.x), containing these countermeasures and resistant to our current
    key-extraction attack, were released concurrently with the first public
    posting of these results. Some of the effects we found (including RSA key
    distinguishability) remain present. <br>
    <h3> Q10: How vulnerable are other algorithms and cryptographic
      implementations?<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
    This is an open research question. Our attack requires careful cryptographic
    analysis of the implementation, which so far has been conducted only for the
    GnuPG 1.x implementation of RSA. Implementations using ciphertext blinding
    (a common side channel countermeasure) appear less vulnerable. We have,
    however, observed that GnuPG's implementation of ElGamal encryption also
    allows acoustically distinguishing keys.<br>
    <h3>Q11: Is there a realistic way to perform a chosen-ciphertext attack on
      GnuPG?</h3>
    <p>To apply the attack to GnuPG, we found a way to cause GnuPG to
      automatically decrypt ciphertexts chosen by the attacker. The idea is to
      use encrypted e-mail messages following the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880">OpenPGP</a>
      and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3516">PGP/MIME</a> protocols.
      For example, <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/">Enigmail</a> (a popular
      plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically decrypts incoming
      e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An attacker can e-mail
      suitably-crafted messages to the victims, wait until they reach the target
      computer, and observe the acoustic signature of their decryption (as shown
      above), thereby closing the adaptive attack loop.</p>
    <h3> Q12: Won't the attack be foiled by loud fan noise, or by multitasking,
      or by several computers in the same room?</h3>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Usually not. The interesting
    acoustic signals are mostly above 10KHz, whereas typical computer fan noise
    and normal room noise are concentrated at lower frequencies and can thus be
    filtered out. In task-switching systems, different tasks can be
    distinguished by their different acoustic spectral signatures. Using
    multiple cores turns out to help the attack (by shifting down the signal
    frequencies). When several computers are present, they can be told apart by
    spatial localization, or by their different acoustic signatures (which vary
    with the hardware, the component temperatures, and other environmental
    conditions). <br>
    <h3> Q13: What countermeasures are available?</h3>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>One
    obvious countermeasure is to use sound dampening equipment, such as
    "sound-proof" boxes, designed to sufficiently attenuate all relevant
    frequencies. Conversely, a sufficiently strong wide-band noise source can
    mask the informative signals, though ergonomic concerns may render this
    unattractive. Careful circuit design and high-quality electronic components
    can probably reduce the emanations. <br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, the cryptographic software can be changed, and algorithmic
    techniques employed to render the emanations less useful to the attacker.
    These techniques ensure that the rough-scale behavior of the algorithm is
    independent of the inputs it receives; they usually carry some performance
    penalty, but are often used in any case to thwart other side-channel
    attacks. This is what we helped implement in GnuPG (see <a href="#Q-GnuPG">Q9</a>).
    <h3> Q14: Why software countermeasures? Isn't it the hardware's
      responsibility to avoid physical leakage?</h3>
    <p>It is tempting to enforce proper layering, and decree that preventing
      physical leakage is the responsibility of the physical hardware.
      Unfortunately, such low-level leakage prevention is often impractical due
      to the very bad cost vs. security tradeoff: (1) any leakage remnants can
      often be amplified by suitable manipulation at the higher levels, as we
      indeed do in our chosen-ciphertext attack; (2) low-level mechanisms try to
      protect all computation, even though most of it is insensitive or does not
      induce easily-exploitable leakage; and (3) leakage is often an inevitable
      side effect of essential performance-enhancing mechanisms (e.g., consider
      <a href="../papers/cache.pdf">cache attacks</a>).<br>
      <br>
      Application-layer, algorithm-specific mitigation, in contrast, prevent the
      (inevitably) leaked signal from bearing any useful information. It is
      often cheap and effective, and most cryptographic software (including
      GnuPG and libgcrypt) already includes various sorts of mitigation, both
      through explicit code and through choice of algorithms. In fact, the
      side-channel resistance of software implementations is nowadays a major
      concern in the choice of cryptographic primitives, and was an explicit
      evaluation criterion in NIST's AES and SHA-3 competitions.</p>
    <h3>Q15: What about other acoustic attacks?</h3>
    <h3><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></h3>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>See the discussion and references
    in our <a href="#paper">paper</a>, and the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_cryptanalysis">Acoustic
      Cryptanalysis</a>. In a nutshell:<br>
    <br>
    Eavesdropping on keyboard keystrokes has been well discussed; keys can be
    distinguished by timing, or by their different sounds. While this attack is
    applicable to data that is entered manually (e.g., passwords), it is not
    applicable to larger secret data such as RSA keys. Another acoustic source
    is hard disk head seeks; this source does not appear very useful in the
    presence of caching, delayed writes and multitasking. Preceding modern
    computers is MI5's "ENGULF" technique (recounted in Peter Wright's book <span
      style="font-style: italic;">Spycatcher</span>), whereby a phone tap was
    used to eavesdrop on the operation of an Egyptian embassy's Hagelin cipher
    machine, thereby recovering its secret key.<span style="font-style: italic;">
    </span>Declassified US government publications describe "TEMPEST" acoustic
    leakage from mechanical and electromechanical devices, but do make no
    mention of modern electronic computers. <br>

    </ul>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3><a name="samples"></a>Q17: What does this acoustic leakage sound like?</h3>
    To human ears, the acoustic leakage typically sounds like a faint,
    high-pitched whining or buzzing noise (if it is at all within audible
    range).&nbsp; However, if we could hear ultrasound, it might sound like this
    <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/img/gnupg-manykeys-downshifted.mp3">processed
      audio recording of GnuPG decrypting several ciphertexts [mp3]</a>. (To
    make it audible, we selected the interesting frequencies using a bandpass
    filter, and then downshifted them to within human hearing range.) In this
    recording, we can discern several pairs of tones. Each such pair is the
    sound made by a single RSA decryption. There are two tones per decryption
    because, internally, each GnuPG RSA decryption first exponentiates modulo
    the secret prime <em>p</em> and then modulo the secret prime <em>q</em> <em>
    </em>? and we can actually hear the difference between these stages.
    Moreover, each of these pairs of tones sounds different <em> </em>?
    because each decryption uses a different key. So in this example, by simply
    listening to the processed signal, we can distinguish between different
    secret keys,<br>
    <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">
    A better way to understand the signal is to visualize it as a spectrogram,
    which plots the acoustic power as a function of time and frequency. For
    example, here is another recording of GnuPG decrypting several RSA
    ciphertexts:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 800px; height: 412px;" title="spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions"
        alt="spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions" src="http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/img/web_manykeys-acoustic.jpg"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    In this spectrogram, the horizontal axis (frequency) spans 40 kHz, and the
    vertical axis (time) spans 1.4 seconds. Each yellow arrow points to the
    middle of a GnuPG RSA decryption. It is easy to see where each decryption
    starts and ends. We also observe that the sound changes halfway through each
    decryption: this is the aforementioned switch from the secret prime <em>p</em>
    to the secret prime <em>q.</em> Most interestingly, we can see the subtle

    <h3><a name="bit-extract"></a>Q18: How do you extract the secret key bits?</h3>
    The key extraction attacks finds the secret key bits one by one,
    sequentially. For each bit, the attacker crafts a ciphertext of a special
    form, that makes the acoustic leakage depend specifically on the value of
    that bit<em></em>. The attacker then triggers decryption of that chosen
    ciphertext, records the resulting sound, and analyzes it. The following
    demonstrates a typical stage of this attack, focusing on a single secret key
    bit. If this bit is 0, then decryption of the chosen ciphertext will sound
    like the left-side spectrogram (with a strong component at 35.2 kHz). If the
    secret bit is 1, the decryption will sound like the right-side spectrogram
    (where the strong component is at 38.1 kHz).<br>

    </div>
    <br>
    Using automated signal classification, the attack tells apart these cases,
    and deduces the secret key bit.<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none;"><span

    <h3><a name="shielding"></a>Q19: Aren't sensitive devices protected by
      shielding?</h3>
    <p>Interestingly, many of the physical side-channel countermeasures used in
      highly sensitive applications, such as air gaps, Faraday cages, and power
      supply filters, provide no protection against acoustic leakage. In
      particular, Faraday cages containing computers require ventilation, which
      is typically provided by means of vents covered with perforated sheet
      metal or metal honeycomb (see <a href="#scenarios">Q1 above</a>). These
      are very effective at attenuating compromising electromagnetic radiation
      (``TEMPEST''), but are nearly transparent to sound.</p>
    <p>For example, the following depicts recording the acoustic emanations
      through a double-honeycomb metal ventilation mesh designed for blocking
      electromagnetic radiation. (Covering this mesh with cardboard eliminates
      the signal.)</p>
