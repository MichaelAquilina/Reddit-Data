<div class="versionadded">
<span class="title">New in Django 1.7.</span> </div>
<p>Migrations are Django&#8217;s way of propagating changes you make to your models
(adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They&#8217;re
designed to be mostly automatic, but you&#8217;ll need to know when to make
migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-a-brief-history">
<span id="a-brief-history"></span><h2>A Brief History<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Prior to version 1.7, Django only supported adding new models to the
database; it was not possible to alter or remove existing models via the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syncdb</span></tt> command (the predecessor to <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-migrate"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">migrate</span></tt></a>).</p>
<p>Third-party tools, most notably <a class="reference external" href="http://south.aeracode.org">South</a>,
provided support for these additional types of change, but it was considered
important enough that support was brought into core Django.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-two-commands">
<span id="two-commands"></span><h2>Two Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#two-commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two commands which you will use to interact with migrations
and Django&#8217;s handling of database schema:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-migrate"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">migrate</span></tt></a>, which is responsible for applying migrations, as well as
unapplying and listing their status.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt></a>, which is responsible for creating new migrations
based on the changes you have made to your models.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that migrations are created and run on a per-app basis.
In particular, it&#8217;s possible to have apps that <em>do not use migrations</em> (these
are referred to as &#8220;unmigrated&#8221; apps) - these apps will instead mimic the
legacy behavior of just adding new models.</p>
<p>You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database
schema. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt> is responsible for packaging up your model changes
into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">migrate</span></tt> is
responsible for applying those to your database.</p>
<p>The migration files for each app live in a &#8220;migrations&#8221; directory inside
of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part
of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine
and then running the same migrations on your colleagues&#8217; machines, your
staging machines, and eventually your production machines.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is possible to override the name of the package which contains the
migrations on a per-app basis by modifying the <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings/#std:setting-MIGRATION_MODULES"><tt class="xref std std-setting docutils literal"><span class="pre">MIGRATION_MODULES</span></tt></a>
setting.</p>
</div>
<p>Migrations will run the same way on the same dataset and produce consistent
results, meaning that what you see in development and staging is, under the
same circumstances, exactly what will happen in production.</p>
<p>Django will make migrations for any change to your models or fields - even
options that don&#8217;t affect the database - as the only way it can reconstruct
a field correctly is to have all the changes in the history, and you might
need those options in some data migrations later on (for example, if you&#8217;ve
set custom validators).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-backend-support">
<span id="backend-support"></span><h2>Backend Support<a class="headerlink" href="#backend-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Migrations are supported on all backends that Django ships with, as well
as any third-party backends if they have programmed in support for schema
alteration (done via the <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/schema-editor/"><em>SchemaEditor</em></a> class).</p>
<p>However, some databases are more capable than others when it comes to
schema migrations; some of the caveats are covered below.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-postgresql">
<span id="postgresql"></span><h3>PostgreSQL<a class="headerlink" href="#postgresql" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>PostgreSQL is the most capable of all the databases here in terms of schema
support; the only caveat is that adding columns with default values will
cause a full rewrite of the table, for a time proportional to its size.</p>
<p>For this reason, it&#8217;s recommended you always create new columns with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">null=True</span></tt>, as this way they will be added immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-mysql">
<span id="mysql"></span><h3>MySQL<a class="headerlink" href="#mysql" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>MySQL lacks support for transactions around schema alteration operations,
meaning that if a migration fails to apply you will have to manually unpick
the changes in order to try again (it&#8217;s impossible to roll back to an
earlier point).</p>
<p>In addition, MySQL will fully rewrite tables for almost every schema operation
and generally takes a time proportional to the number of rows in the table to
add or remove columns. On slower hardware this can be worse than a minute per
million rows - adding a few columns to a table with just a few million rows
could lock your site up for over ten minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, MySQL has reasonably small limits on name lengths for columns, tables
and indexes, as well as a limit on the combined size of all columns an index
covers. This means that indexes that are possible on other backends will
fail to be created under MySQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-sqlite">
<span id="sqlite"></span><h3>SQLite<a class="headerlink" href="#sqlite" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SQLite has very little built-in schema alteration support, and so Django
attempts to emulate it by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Creating a new table with the new schema</li>
<li>Copying the data across</li>
<li>Dropping the old table</li>
<li>Renaming the new table to match the original name</li>
</ul>
<p>This process generally works well, but it can be slow and occasionally
buggy. It is not recommended that you run and migrate SQLite in a
production environment unless you are very aware of the risks and
its limitations; the support Django ships with is designed to allow
developers to use SQLite on their local machines to develop less complex
Django projects without the need for a full database.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-workflow">
<span id="workflow"></span><h2>Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Working with migrations is simple. Make changes to your models - say, add
a field and remove a model - and then run <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'books':
  0003_auto.py:
    - Alter field author on book</pre>
</div>
<p>Your models will be scanned and compared to the versions currently
contained in your migration files, and then a new set of migrations
will be written out. Make sure to read the output to see what
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt> thinks you have changed - it&#8217;s not perfect, and for
complex changes it might not be detecting what you expect.</p>
<p>Once you have your new migration files, you should apply them to your
database to make sure they work as expected:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Synchronize unmigrated apps: sessions, admin, messages, auth, staticfiles, contenttypes
  Apply all migrations: books
Synchronizing apps without migrations:
  Creating tables...
  Installing custom SQL...
  Installing indexes...
Installed 0 object(s) from 0 fixture(s)
Running migrations:
  Applying books.0003_auto... OK</pre>
</div>
<p>The command runs in two stages; first, it synchronizes unmigrated apps
(performing the same functionality that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">syncdb</span></tt> used to provide), and
then it runs any migrations that have not yet been applied.</p>
<p>Once the migration is applied, commit the migration and the models change
to your version control system as a single commit - that way, when other
developers (or your production servers) check out the code, they&#8217;ll
get both the changes to your models and the accompanying migration at the
same time.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-version-control">
<span id="version-control"></span><h3>Version control<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because migrations are stored in version control, you&#8217;ll occasionally
come across situations where you and another developer have both committed
a migration to the same app at the same time, resulting in two migrations
with the same number.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry - the numbers are just there for developers&#8217; reference, Django
just cares that each migration has a different name. Migrations specify which
other migrations they depend on - including earlier migrations in the same
app - in the file, so it&#8217;s possible to detect when there&#8217;s two new migrations
for the same app that aren&#8217;t ordered.</p>
<p>When this happens, Django will prompt you and give you some options. If it
thinks it&#8217;s safe enough, it will offer to automatically linearize the two
migrations for you. If not, you&#8217;ll have to go in and modify the migrations
yourself - don&#8217;t worry, this isn&#8217;t difficult, and is explained more in
<a class="reference internal" href="#migration-files"><em>Migration files</em></a> below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-dependencies">
<span id="dependencies"></span><h2>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While migrations are per-app, the tables and relationships implied by
your models are too complex to be created for just one app at a time. When
you make a migration that requires something else to run - for example,
you add a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ForeignKey</span></tt> in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">books</span></tt> app to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">authors</span></tt> app - the
resulting migration will contain a dependency on a migration in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">authors</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This means that when you run the migrations, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">authors</span></tt> migration runs
first and creates the table the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ForeignKey</span></tt> references, and then the migration
that makes the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ForeignKey</span></tt> column runs afterwards and creates the constraint.
If this didn&#8217;t happen, the migration would try to create the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ForeignKey</span></tt>
column without the table it&#8217;s referencing existing and your database would
throw an error.</p>
<p>This dependency behavior affects most migration operations where you
restrict to a single app. Restricting to a single app (either in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">migrate</span></tt>) is a best-efforts promise, and not
a guarantee; any other apps that need to be used to get dependencies correct
will be.</p>
<p id="unmigrated-dependencies">Be aware, however, that unmigrated apps cannot depend on migrated apps, by the
very nature of not having migrations. This means that it is not generally
possible to have an unmigrated app have a ForeignKey or ManyToManyField to
a migrated app; some cases may work, but it will eventually fail.</p>
<p>This is particularly apparent if you use swappable models (e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AUTH_USER_MODEL</span></tt>), as every app that uses swappable models will need
to have migrations if you&#8217;re unlucky. As time goes on, more and more
third-party apps will get migrations, but in the meantime you can either
give them migrations yourself (using <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings/#std:setting-MIGRATION_MODULES"><tt class="xref std std-setting docutils literal"><span class="pre">MIGRATION_MODULES</span></tt></a> to
store those modules outside of the app&#8217;s own module if you wish), or
keep the app with your user model unmigrated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-migration-files">
<span id="s-id1"></span><span id="migration-files"></span><span id="id1"></span><h2>Migration files<a class="headerlink" href="#migration-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Migrations are stored as an on-disk format, referred to here as
&#8220;migration files&#8221;. These files are actually just normal Python files with
an agreed-upon object layout, written in a declarative style.</p>
<p>A basic migration file looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">migrations</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">models</span>

    <span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What Django looks for when it loads a migration file (as a Python module) is
a subclass of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.db.migrations.Migration</span></tt> called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Migration</span></tt>. It then
inspects this object for four attributes, only two of which are used
most of the time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dependencies</span></tt>, a list of migrations this one depends on.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operations</span></tt>, a list of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Operation</span></tt> classes that define what this
migration does.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operations are the key; they are a set of declarative instructions which
tell Django what schema changes need to be made. Django scans them and
builds an in-memory representation of all of the schema changes to all apps,
and uses this to generate the SQL which makes the schema changes.</p>
<p>That in-memory structure is also used to work out what the differences are
between your models and the current state of your migrations; Django runs
through all the changes, in order, on an in-memory set of models to come
up with the state of your models last time you ran <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt>. It
then uses these models to compare against the ones in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">models.py</span></tt> files
to work out what you have changed.</p>
<p>You should rarely, if ever, need to edit migration files by hand, but
it&#8217;s entirely possible to write them manually if you need to. Some of the
more complex operations are not autodetectable and are only available via
a hand-written migration, so don&#8217;t be scared about editing them if you have to.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-custom-fields">
<span id="custom-fields"></span><h3>Custom fields<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t modify the number of positional arguments in an already migrated
custom field without raising a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></tt>. The old migration will call the
modified <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt> method with the old signature. So if you need a new
argument, please create a keyword argument and add something like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">assert</span> <span class="pre">kwargs.get('argument_name')</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">None</span></tt> in the constructor.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="s-adding-migrations-to-apps">
<span id="adding-migrations-to-apps"></span><h2>Adding migrations to apps<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-migrations-to-apps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Adding migrations to new apps is straightforward - they come preconfigured to
accept migrations, and so just run <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt></a> once you&#8217;ve made
some changes.</p>
<p>If your app already has models and database tables, and doesn&#8217;t have migrations
yet (for example, you created it against a previous Django version), you&#8217;ll
need to convert it to use migrations; this is a simple process:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ python manage.py makemigrations your_app_label</pre>
</div>
<p>This will make a new initial migration for your app. Now, when you run
<a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-migrate"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">migrate</span></tt></a>, Django will detect that you have an initial migration
<em>and</em> that the tables it wants to create already exist, and will mark the
migration as already applied.</p>
<p>Note that this only works given two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You have not changed your models since you made their tables. For migrations
to work, you must make the initial migration <em>first</em> and then make changes,
as Django compares changes against migration files, not the database.</li>
<li>You have not manually edited your database - Django won&#8217;t be able to detect
that your database doesn&#8217;t match your models, you&#8217;ll just get errors when
migrations try to modify those tables.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-historical-models">
<span id="s-id2"></span><span id="historical-models"></span><span id="id2"></span><h2>Historical models<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you run migrations, Django is working from historical versions of
your models stored in the migration files. If you write Python code
using the <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython" title="django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">RunPython</span></tt></a> operation, or if
you have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">allow_migrate</span></tt> methods on your database routers, you will be
exposed to these versions of your models.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s impossible to serialize arbitrary Python code, these historical
models will not have any custom methods or managers that you have defined.
They will, however, have the same fields, relationships and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Meta</span></tt> options
(also versioned, so they may be different from your current ones).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This means that you will NOT have custom <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">save()</span></tt> methods called on objects
when you access them in migrations, and you will NOT have any custom
constructors or instance methods. Plan appropriately!</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, the base classes of the model are just stored as pointers,
so you must always keep base classes around for as long as there is a migration
that contains a reference to them. On the plus side, methods and managers
from these base classes inherit normally, so if you absolutely need access
to these you can opt to move them into a superclass.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-data-migrations">
<span id="s-id3"></span><span id="data-migrations"></span><span id="id3"></span><h2>Data Migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#data-migrations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As well as changing the database schema, you can also use migrations to change
the data in the database itself, in conjunction with the schema if you want.</p>
<p>Migrations that alter data are usually called &#8220;data migrations&#8221;; they&#8217;re best
written as separate migrations, sitting alongside your schema migrations.</p>
<p>Django can&#8217;t automatically generate data migrations for you, as it does with
schema migrations, but it&#8217;s not very hard to write them. Migration files in
Django are made up of <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/"><em>Operations</em></a>, and
the main operation you use for data migrations is
<a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython" title="django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">RunPython</span></tt></a>.</p>
<p>To start, make an empty migration file you can work from (Django will put
the file in the right place, suggest a name, and add dependencies for you):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>python manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname</pre>
</div>
<p>Then, open up the file; it should look something like this:</p>

<p>Now, all you need to do is create a new function and have

which takes two arguments - the first is an <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/applications/"><em>app registry</em></a> that has the historical versions of all your models
loaded into it to match where in your history the migration sits, and the
second is a <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/schema-editor/"><em>SchemaEditor</em></a>, which you can use to
manually effect database schema changes (but beware, doing this can confuse
the migration autodetector!)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s write a simple migration that populates our new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></tt> field with the
combined values of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first_name</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">last_name</span></tt> (we&#8217;ve come to our senses
and realized that not everyone has first and last names). All we
need to do is use the historical model and iterate over the rows:</p>

<p>Once that&#8217;s done, we can just run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">manage.py</span> <span class="pre">migrate</span></tt> as normal and

<span id="s-migration-squashing"></span><span id="squashing-migrations"></span><span id="migration-squashing"></span><h2>Squashing migrations<a class="headerlink" href="#squashing-migrations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You are encouraged to make migrations freely and not worry about how many you
have; the migration code is optimized to deal with hundreds at a time without
much slowdown. However, eventually you will want to move back from having
several hundred migrations to just a few, and that&#8217;s where squashing comes in.</p>
<p>Squashing is the act of reducing an existing set of many migrations down to
one (or sometimes a few) migrations which still represent the same changes.</p>
<p>Django does this by taking all of your existing migrations, extracting their
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Operation</span></tt>s and putting them all in sequence, and then running an optimizer
over them to try and reduce the length of the list - for example, it knows
that <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.CreateModel" title="django.db.migrations.operations.CreateModel"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">CreateModel</span></tt></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.DeleteModel" title="django.db.migrations.operations.DeleteModel"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">DeleteModel</span></tt></a> cancel each other out,
and it knows that <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.AddField" title="django.db.migrations.operations.AddField"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">AddField</span></tt></a> can be
rolled into <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.CreateModel" title="django.db.migrations.operations.CreateModel"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">CreateModel</span></tt></a>.</p>
<p>Once the operation sequence has been reduced as much as possible - the amount
possible depends on how closely intertwined your models are and if you have
any <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL" title="django.db.migrations.operations.RunSQL"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">RunSQL</span></tt></a>
or <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/migration-operations/#django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython" title="django.db.migrations.operations.RunPython"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">RunPython</span></tt></a> operations (which can&#8217;t
be optimized through) - Django will them write it back out into a new set of
initial migration files.</p>
<p>These files are marked to say they replace the previously-squashed migrations,
so they can coexist with the old migration files, and Django will intelligently
switch between them depending where you are in the history. If you&#8217;re still
part-way through the set of migrations that you squashed, it will keep using
them until it hits the end and then switch to the squashed history, while new
installs will just use the new squashed migration and skip all the old ones.</p>
<p>This enables you to squash and not mess up systems currently in production
that aren&#8217;t fully up-to-date yet. The recommended process is to squash, keeping
the old files, commit and release, wait until all systems are upgraded with
the new release (or if you&#8217;re a third-party project, just ensure your users
upgrade releases in order without skipping any), and then remove the old files,
commit and do a second release.</p>
<p>The command that backs all this is <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-squashmigrations"><tt class="xref std std-djadmin docutils literal"><span class="pre">squashmigrations</span></tt></a> - just pass
it the app label and migration name you want to squash up to, and it&#8217;ll get to
work:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$ ./manage.py squashmigrations myapp 0004
Will squash the following migrations:
 - 0001_initial
 - 0002_some_change
 - 0003_another_change
 - 0004_undo_something
Do you wish to proceed? [yN] y
Optimizing...
  Optimized from 12 operations to 7 operations.
Created new squashed migration /home/andrew/Programs/DjangoTest/test/migrations/0001_squashed_0004_undo_somthing.py
  You should commit this migration but leave the old ones in place;
  the new migration will be used for new installs. Once you are sure
  all instances of the codebase have applied the migrations you squashed,
  you can delete them.</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that model interdependencies in Django can get very complex, and squashing
may occasionally result in an optimized migration that doesn&#8217;t work or is
impossible to run. When this occurs, you can re-try with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--no-optimize</span></tt>, but
please <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">file a bug report</a> either
way detailing the models and their relationships so we can improve the
optimizer to handle your case.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-serializing-values">
<span id="s-migration-serializing"></span><span id="serializing-values"></span><span id="migration-serializing"></span><h2>Serializing values<a class="headerlink" href="#serializing-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Migrations are just Python files containing the old definitions of your models
- thus, to write them, Django must take the current state of your models and
serialize them out into a file.</p>
<p>While Django can serialize most things, there are some things that we just
can&#8217;t serialize out into a valid Python representation - there&#8217;s no Python
standard for how a value can be turned back into code (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">repr()</span></tt> only works
for basic values, and doesn&#8217;t specify import paths).</p>
<p>Django can serialize the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">int</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">long</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">float</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bool</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">str</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unicode</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bytes</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">list</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">set</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tuple</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dict</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">datetime.date</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">datetime.datetime</span></tt> instances</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">decimal.Decimal</span></tt> instances</li>
<li>Any Django field</li>
<li>Any function or method reference (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">datetime.datetime.today</span></tt>)</li>
<li>Any class reference</li>
<li>Anything with a custom <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deconstruct()</span></tt> method (<a class="reference internal" href="#custom-deconstruct-method"><em>see below</em></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Django can serialize the following on Python 3 only:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unbound methods used from within the class body (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>Django cannot serialize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Arbitrary class instances (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyClass(4.3,</span> <span class="pre">5.7)</span></tt>)</li>
<li>Lambdas</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the fact <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__qualname__</span></tt> was only introduced in Python 3, Django can only
serialize the following pattern (an unbound method used within the class body)
on Python 3, and will fail to serialize a reference to it on Python 2:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyModel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">upload_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;something dynamic&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">my_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FileField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">upload_to</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">upload_to</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are using Python 2, we recommend you move your methods for upload_to
and similar arguments that accept callables (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">default</span></tt>) to live in
the main module body, rather than the class body.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-adding-a-deconstruct-method">
<span id="s-custom-deconstruct-method"></span><span id="adding-a-deconstruct-method"></span><span id="custom-deconstruct-method"></span><h3>Adding a deconstruct() method<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-deconstruct-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can let Django serialize your own custom class instances by giving the class
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deconstruct()</span></tt> method. It takes no arguments, and should return a tuple
of three things: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(path,</span> <span class="pre">args,</span> <span class="pre">kwargs)</span></tt>. Note this return value is different
from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deconstruct()</span></tt> method <a class="reference internal" href="../../howto/custom-model-fields/#custom-field-deconstruct-method"><em>for custom fields</em></a> which returns a tuple of four items.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">path</span></tt> should be the Python path to the class, with the class name included as the
last part (for example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myapp.custom_things.MyClass</span></tt>). If your class is not
available at the top level of a module it is not serializable.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">args</span></tt> should be a list of positional arguments to pass to your class&#8217;
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt> method. Everything in this list should itself be serializable.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kwargs</span></tt> should be a dict of keyword arguments to pass to your class&#8217;
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt> method. Every value should itself be serializable.</p>
<p>Django will write out the value as an instantiation of your class with the
given arguments, similar to the way it writes out references to Django fields.</p>
<p>As long as all of the arguments to your class&#8217; constructor are themselves
serializable, you can just use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;deconstructible</span></tt> class decorator
from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.utils.deconstruct</span></tt> to add the method:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.utils.deconstruct</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">deconstructible</span>

<span class="nd">@deconstructible</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyCustomClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The decorator adds logic to capture and preserve the arguments on their
way into your constructor, and then returns those arguments exactly when
deconstruct() is called.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-upgrading-from-south">
<span id="upgrading-from-south"></span><h2>Upgrading from South<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-from-south" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you already have pre-existing migrations created with
<a class="reference external" href="http://south.aeracode.org">South 0.x</a>, then the upgrade process to use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django.db.migrations</span></tt> is quite simple:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ensure all installs are fully up-to-date with their migrations</li>
<li>Delete all your (numbered) migration files, but not the directory or
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></tt> - make sure you remove the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt> files too.</li>
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">manage.py</span> <span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt>. Django should see the empty
migration directories and make new initial migrations in the new format.</li>
<li>Run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">manage.py</span> <span class="pre">migrate</span></tt>. Django will see that the tables for the
initial migrations already exist and mark them as applied without running
them.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it! The only complication is if you have a circular dependency loop
of foreign keys; in this case, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makemigrations</span></tt> might make more than one
initial migration, and you&#8217;ll need to mark them all as applied using:</p>
