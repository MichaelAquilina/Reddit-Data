  <section class="body" id="post-top">
    <p>From now on, you should see a delightful lock <img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-0-lock.png" /> next to <a href="https://konklone.com">https://konklone.com</a> in your browser&#39;s URL bar, because I&#39;ve switched this site to use HTTPS. I paid <strong>$0</strong> for the trouble.</p>

<p>Why you should bother doing the same:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSL&#39;s not perfect, but we need to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance">make surveillance as expensive as possible</a></li>
<li>For privacy not to be suspicious, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS">privacy should be on by default</a></li>
<li>And hey, bonus: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1361720/16075">more complete referrer information</a> for people visiting from sites already using HTTPS (like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This post shows how to do your part in building a surveillance-resistant Internet by switching your site to HTTPS. Though it takes a bunch of steps, each one is very simple, and you should be able to finish this in <strong>under an hour</strong>.</p>

<p>A quick overview: to use HTTPS on the web today, you need to obtain a certificate file that&#39;s signed by a company that browsers trust. Once you have it, you tell your web server where it is, where your associated private key is, and open up port 443 for business. You don&#39;t necessarily have to be a professional software developer to do this, but you do need to be <strong>okay with the command line</strong>, and comfortable configuring <strong>a web server you control</strong>.</p>

<p>Most certificates cost money, but at Micah Lee&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/micahflee/status/368163493049933824">suggestion</a>, I used <a href="https://www.startssl.com">StartSSL</a>. They&#39;re who the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> uses, and <strong>their basic certificates for individuals are free</strong>. </p>

<p>There are two things that could cost you money. One is that if your site is commercial in nature, they&#39;ll ask you to pay for a higher level certificate. </p>

<p>More importantly, if your certificate needs to be revoked someday, StartCom will <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=25#72">charge you a $30 fee</a>. While revocation has generally been rare, the recently discovered <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> exploit is an example where a huge portion of the Internet has had to revoke their keys. For some people who had issued a large number of free certificates, this turned out to be expensive.</p>

<p>Still, StartCom makes getting started with SSL simple and inexpensive. Their website is difficult to use at first — especially if you&#39;re new to the concepts and terminology behind SSL certificates (like me). Fortunately, it&#39;s not actually that hard; it&#39;s just a lot of small steps.</p>

<p>Below, we&#39;ll go step by step through signing up with StartSSL and creating your certificate. We&#39;ll also cover installing it via nginx, but you can use the certificate with whatever web server you want.</p>

<h2 id="register-with-startssl">Register with StartSSL</h2>

<p>To get started, <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=11&amp;action=regform">visit their signup page</a> and enter your information.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-1-signup.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>They&#39;ll email you a verification code. They tell you to <strong>not close the tab</strong> or navigate away from it, so just keep it open until you get the code, and can paste it in.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-2-signup-verify.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>You&#39;ll need to wait for certification, but it should only take a few minutes. Once you&#39;re approved, they&#39;ll email you a special link and a verification code to type in. </p>

<p>That&#39;ll bring you to a screen to generate a private key. They&#39;re generating you this private key inside your browser, using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/keygen">&quot;keygen&quot; tag</a>. However, <strong>this isn&#39;t the key you use to make your SSL certificate</strong>. They&#39;re using it to create a separate &quot;authentication certificate&quot; that you will use to log in to StartSSL&#39;s control panel going forward. You&#39;ll make a separate certificate for your website later.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-3-auth-key-generate.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Finally, they&#39;ll ask you to &quot;Install&quot; the certificate:</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-4-auth-cert.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Which installs your authentication certificate directly into your browser. </p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-5-auth-cert-installed.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>If you&#39;re in Chrome, you should see this at the top of your browser window:</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-6-auth-cert-chrome-install.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Again, this is just the certificate that identifies you by your email address and lets you log in to StartSSL going forward.</p>

<p>Now, we need to persuade StartSSL that we own the domain name we want to generate a new certificate for. From the control panel, click the &quot;Validations Wizard&quot; tab, and select &quot;Domain Name Validation&quot; from the dropdown.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-7-begin-domain.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Enter your domain name.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-8-choose-domain.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Next, you&#39;ll select an email address that StartSSL will use to verify you own the domain name. </p>

<p>As you can see, StartSSL will believe you own the domain if you control webmaster@, postmaster@, or hostmaster@ with the domain name, <strong>OR</strong> if you own the email address listed as part of the domain&#39;s registrant information (in my case, that&#39;s currently <code>konklone@gmail.com</code>). Choose an email address where you can receive mail.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-9-choose-domain-email.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>They&#39;ll email you a validation code, which you can enter into the field to validate the domain. </p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-10-domain-validate.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-11-domain-done.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<h2 id="generating-the-certificate">Generating the certificate</h2>

<p>Now that StartSSL knows who you are, and knows you own a domain, you can generate your certificate using a private key.</p>

<p>While StartSSL <strong>can</strong> generate a private key for you — and their FAQ assures you they use only the <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=25#43">highest quality random numbers</a> and <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=25#44">don&#39;t hold onto the key</a> afterwards — it&#39;s also easy to create your own. </p>

<p>This guide will cover creating your own via the command line. If you choose to let StartSSL&#39;s wizard do it, you can pick back up with this guide a couple steps down, where you choose the domain the certificate should apply to.</p>

<p>To create a new 2048-bit RSA key, open up your terminal and run: </p>

<p><code>openssl genrsa -aes256 -out my-private-encrypted.key 2048</code></p>

<p>You&#39;ll be asked to choose a pass phrase. <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">Pick a good one</a>, and <strong>remember it</strong>. This will generate an <em>encrypted</em> private key. If you ever need to transfer your key, via the network or anything else, use the encrypted version.</p>

<p>The next step is to decrypt it so that you can generate a &quot;certificate signing request&quot; with it. To decrypt your private key:</p>

<p><code>openssl rsa -in my-private-encrypted.key -out my-private-decrypted.key</code></p>

<p>Now, generate a certificate signing request:</p>

<p><code>openssl req -new -key my-private-decrypted.key -out mydomain.com.csr</code></p>

<p>Go back to StartSSL&#39;s control panel and click the &quot;Certificates Wizard&quot; tab, and select &quot;Web Server SSL/TLS Certificate&quot; from the dropdown.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-12-cert-begin.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Since we generated our own private key, you can hit &quot;**Skip**&quot; here.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-13-cert-key-skip.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Then, paste in the contents of the .csr file we generated earlier.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-14-csr-enter.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>If all goes well, it should say it received your certificate signing request.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-15-csr-received.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>Now, choose the domain you validated earlier which you plan to use with the certificate.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-16-choose-domain.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>It requires you to add a subdomain. I added &quot;www&quot; for mine.</p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-17-choose-subdomain.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<p>It will ask you to confirm. If it looks right, hit &quot;Continue&quot;. </p>

<div class="container"><img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-18-cert-ready.png" class="block upper border" /></div>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Note</strong>: It's possible you'll get hit with a "Additional Check Required!" step here, where you wait for approval by email. It didn't happen to me the first time, but did the second time, and my approval arrived in ~30 minutes. Upon approval, you'll need to visit the "Tool Box" tab and visit "Retrieve Certificate" to get your cert.
</div>

<p>That should do it — your certificate will appear in a text field for you to copy and paste into a file. Call it whatever you want, but the rest of the guide will refer to it as <code>mydomain.com.crt</code>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-the-certificate-in-nginx">Installing the certificate in nginx</h2>

<p>If you have direct access to your web server and its nginx configuration, here&#39;s how to install your certificate. If you don&#39;t, check out <a href="#setup-with-other-common-hosts">setup options for other common hosts</a> or <a href="https://www.insecure.ws/2013/10/11/ssltls-configuration-for-apache-mod_ssl/">for Apache</a>.</p>

<p>First, make sure <strong>port 443 is open</strong> on your web server. Many web hosts automatically keep this port open for you. If you&#39;re using Amazon AWS, you&#39;ll need to make sure your instance&#39;s Security Group has port 443 open.</p>

<p>Next, we&#39;re going to create the &quot;certificate chain&quot; that your web server will use. It contains your certificate, and StartSSL&#39;s intermediary certificate. (Including StartSSL&#39;s root cert is not necessary, because browsers ship with it already.) Download the intermediate certificate from StartSSL:</p>

<p><code>wget https://www.startssl.com/certs/sub.class1.server.ca.pem</code></p>

<p>Then concatenate your certificate with theirs:</p>

<p><code>cat mydomain.com.crt sub.class1.server.ca.pem &gt; unified.crt</code></p>

<p>Finally, tell your web server about your unified certificate, and your decrypted private key. I use nginx — below is the bare minimum nginx configuration you need. It redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS requests using a 301 permanent redirect, and points the server to the certificate and key.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/konklone/6416795.js"></script>

<div class="callout">
You can also check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/konklone/6532544">a more complete HTTPS nginx configuration</a> that turns on <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>, SSL <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sslyze/wiki/SessionResumption">session resumption</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, and enables <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/pushing-perfect-forward-secrecy-important-web-privacy-protection">Forward Secrecy</a>. 
<br/><br/>
Qualys' SSL Labs offers an excellent <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html">SSL testing tool</a> you can use to see how you're doing.
</div>

<p>Now, ensure your nginx configuration is okay (this also verifies that the key and certificate are in working order):</p>

<p><code>sudo nginx -t</code></p>

<p>Then restart nginx:</p>

<p><code>sudo service nginx restart</code></p>

<p>Cross your fingers and try it out in your browser! If all goes well, the <img src="/assets/images/blog/https/ssl-0-lock.png" /> will be yours.</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Important:</strong> the StartSSL free Class 1 certificate is good for just <strong>1 year</strong>. Don't forget to renew it before then! Set a calendar reminder or something!
<br/><br/>
If you want a longer lifespan of 2 years, you can get a <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=34">Class 2 Identity</a> certificate, just be prepared to pay $60 and get your address verified (possibly through the physical mail!).
</div>

<h2 id="setup-with-other-common-hosts">Setup with other common hosts</h2>

<p>Many common hosts don&#39;t give you direct access to install a certificate yourself. In that case, you&#39;ll probably have to pay $$ for HTTPS, if it&#39;s possible at all.</p>

<p>If you use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon S3</strong>, as of March 2014 they support <strong><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/custom-ssl-domains/">free SSL for custom domains</a></strong> via CloudFront. Bear in mind this requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI</a>, which won&#39;t work for users on Windows XP. If that&#39;s a dealbreaker, then you&#39;d have to pay an insane $600/month for a dedicated IP.</li>
<li><strong>Apache</strong>, check out <a href="https://www.insecure.ws/2013/10/11/ssltls-configuration-for-apache-mod_ssl/">kang&#39;s blog post</a> on making an Apache config that gets the A rating from Qualys.</li>
<li><strong>Heroku</strong>, you&#39;ll need to pay $20/month for their <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/ssl">SSL add-on</a>, and then use it to <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint">set up an SSL endpoint</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Webfaction</strong>, they <a href="http://docs.webfaction.com/user-guide/websites.html#secure-sites-https">provide HTTPS support</a> at no extra charge. Go <a href="https://www.webfaction.com/">Webfaction</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Github Pages</strong>, they don&#39;t offer HTTPS support for either <code>*.github.io</code> domains, or custom domains, so you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to <strong>look elsewhere</strong> because your host makes it too expensive or impossible to set up HTTPS, another option is to sign up for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>. You don&#39;t need to leave your current host to use them — they sit &quot;in front&quot; of your website and can speed it up in various ways. Every paid plan, starting at $20/month, <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/easiest-ssl-ever-now-included-automatically-w">includes HTTPS support</a>.</p>

<p>Later in 2014, Cloudflare <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/CloudFlare/status/450390445365800961">plans to offer SSL for free</a></strong>, as part of their mission to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/17/5217800/cloudflare-pledges-to-double-ssl-usage-on-the-web-in-2014">double SSL on the web in 2014</a>. That will be huge.</p>

<h2 id="mixed-content-warnings">Mixed Content Warnings</h2>

<p>If your site is running on HTTPS, it&#39;s important to make sure all linked resources — images, stylesheets, JavaScript, etc. — are HTTPS too. If they&#39;re not, users&#39; browsers will complain. Newer versions of Firefox will <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2013/04/10/mixed-content-blocking-enabled-in-firefox-23/">outright block insecure content</a> on a secure page.</p>

<p>Fortunately, pretty much every major service with embed code has an HTTPS version, and most (including Google Analytics and Typekit) handle it automatically. For others, you&#39;ll need to figure it out on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Where you need to support both HTTP and HTTPS, use <a href="http://billpatrianakos.me/blog/2013/04/18/protocol-relative-urls/">protocol-relative URLs</a> (starting URLs with <code>//domain.com</code>). They&#39;re supported just about everywhere except (of course) for IE6.</p>

<h2 id="back-up-your-keys-and-certificates">Back up your keys and certificates</h2>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to <strong>back up your SSL certificate, and its encrypted private key</strong>. I put them in a private git repository, and included a brief text file describing every other file, and the process or command that created it. Make sure to <strong>record when your certificate expires</strong>, and <strong>set a calendar alarm</strong> for that date!</p>

<p>You should also <strong>back up your authentication certificate</strong> that you use to log in to StartSSL. StartSSL&#39;s FAQ <a href="https://www.startssl.com/?app=25#4">has instructions</a> — it&#39;s a .p12 file containing a cert + key that you export from your browser.</p>

    <p>@Chris - I&#39;ve actually &quot;upgraded&quot; to Class 2 certs, which means that StartCom also validated my home address (they mailed me a code to type in). I had originally done this process for a cert for isitchristmas.com, just to try it out and go over-the-top. </p>

<p>When I re-issued this blog&#39;s cert for Heartbleed, I automatically got issued a Class 2, since they still had my address validation on file. So now I don&#39;t have a Class 1 anywhere. </p>

<p>But you can look at <a href="https://www.penflip.com/" rel='nofollow'><a href="https://www.penflip.com/">https://www.penflip.com/</a></a>, which uses a Class 1 free cert from StartSSL - they seem to be visible, according to the site:</p>

    <p>@Ben, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s widespread agreement that startSSL is &quot;violating the public trust&quot;, let alone that any browsers should untrust them.  They have always stated upfront that they charge a fee for certificate revocation so that cannot be called a violation of trust; moreover I&#39;ve seen at least one report that when users cited the Heartbleed CVE as the revocation reason that StartSSL waived the normal fee.  It seems to me that banning startSSL would be cutting off your nose to spite your face.</p>

    <p>Hi Eric,
are you still using the startSSL free certificate?  I&#39;m trying to figure out whether China is still blocking all sites that use startSSL free certificates.  According to blockedinchina.net, konklone.com is accessible in China now, so I&#39;m wondering...</p>

    <p>This is a good tutorial, but it&#39;s too bad that StartSSL is violating the public trust re: Heartbleed. Having one of their certificates isn&#39;t going to get you much if the folks pushing to untrust StartCom movement is successful.</p>

<p>I wish there was an alternative, but in the mean time, I&#39;ve decided paying for a certificate up front is better than being extorted if it it compromised by the largest security flaw the Internet has ever seen.</p>

    <p>Hi, hopefully I did everything right except for this one thing. I have had so much trouble trying to get this to work. I even dual booted windows 8 and ubuntu so I can do this. But for some reason I get this weird error when I do sudo nginx -t</p>

<p>This is the error:
nginx: [emerg] &quot;server&quot; directive is not allowed here in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:97
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed</p>

<p>Any help? Thanks so much!</p>

    <p>Thanks, Sagar! I added a link to the protocol-relative URLs to the post, and described what they are. Good idea.</p>

<p>The relative URLs thing is interesting, but I have mixed feelings. However, it did definitely make me realize that we (my employer, <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com" rel='nofollow'><a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com">https://sunlightfoundation.com</a></a>) have duplicate content issues with some of our staging sites, so that was a huge help to me in my work. :)</p>

    <p>Very nice tutorial. I followed it step-by-step and switched my personal website to https with no pain at all :) Thank you very much.</p>

<p>One improvement to this tutorial could be some links/resources pointing out how to deal with mixed content warnings. This is what took me the most time to figure out. As I see it, there are two main approaches</p>

<ol>
<li>Use relative URLs everywhere. BUT this is considered to be a bad thing by some. See <a href="http://yoast.com/relative-urls-issues/" rel='nofollow'><a href="http://yoast.com/relative-urls-issues/">http://yoast.com/relative-urls-issues/</a></a></li>
<li>Use protocol relative urls. For example: <a href="http://billpatrianakos.me/blog/2013/04/18/protocol-relative-urls/" rel='nofollow'><a href="http://billpatrianakos.me/blog/2013/04/18/protocol-relative-urls/">http://billpatrianakos.me/blog/2013/04/18/protocol-relative-urls/</a></a></li>

    <p>Thanks for the post! Happy see TLS adoption interest spread. For various secure configuration examples, I suggest checking out the &quot;duraconf&quot; project, you can find secure TLS settings for various applications, including Apache/NGINX/etc, including ones that force perfect forward secrecy providing cipher suites. The project and it&#39;s configuration examples are on Github: <a href="https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf" rel='nofollow'><a href="https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf">https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf</a></a></p>

    <p>Using a client cert to log in to startssl that should be backed up is stupid. When you generate a key on a Chromebook it&#39;s hardware-protected and CAN&#39;T be backed up.</p>

<p>This is an awesome feature of Chromebooks, but assumes that nobody does something as stupid as startssl.com does.</p>

    <p>@hi - Yes, you do, at least temporarily while you generate the CSR. </p>

<p>My installation instructions also have you leave the decrypted private key on disk and point nginx at it, but I believe you can also point nginx at the encrypted version instead -- if you&#39;re willing to type in the decryption password each time you start/restart nginx.</p>
