<h1 class="posttitle">When A Mouse Requires An Internet Connection, You're Doing 'Cloud' Wrong</h1><h3>from the <i>so-many-options-for-the-hardware,-so-few-for-the-users</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
In a situation eerily similar to "<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110727/12064015286/ubisoft-learns-nothing-its-drm-past-condemns-paying-customers-to-repeat-it.shtml" target="_blank">always-on</a>" DRM schemes, Razer mouse and keyboard purchasers are finding their high-end peripherals bricked by software that requires an internet connection to function.
<br/><br/>
So, why would a mouse need an internet connection to be usable? Well, it&#39;s supposed to be a feature, but it&#39;s behaving more like a bug. <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1319323/razer-synapse-2-0-software-mouse-unusable-if-you-dont-have-an-internet-connection-or-their-servers-are-down" target="_blank">A forum member at Overclock.net explains the problem with his new ~$80 mouse</a>:
<blockquote>
<i>This really took me by surprise. Just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the software and get greeted by a login screen right after. No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse, set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros etc.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>So I go ahead and create an account and try to log in. Nothing. Try several more times, and still nothing. Try to make new accounts with different email addresses and it still wont work.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>Finally call Razer who tells me the activation server is down, and I wont be able to use the mouse until it goes back up and will only be able to use it as a standard plug and play mouse til then. I ask about a workaround to use the mouse offline and they say there is none. Supposedly once the mouse is activated on the computer offline mode will work, but it needs to upload my profile and activate my account first and since their server is down its not going to happen. I ask for a supervisor to confirm this is the case and ask again for a workaround to use it offline. He said sorry theres nothing they can do, tells me the call center is closing and hangs up on me.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>I&#39;m pretty shocked Razer thought it was a good idea to do this to customers. Nowhere on the box does it say anything about needing an internet connection to "activate" a mouse. If the servers go down in the future, anyone who buys this mouse is out of luck.</i>
</blockquote>
The idea behind this unfortunate requirement is to save your gaming preferences for supported mice and keyboards to the cloud so the next time you&#39;re at a LAN party (assuming your LAN party lets you "dial out," so to speak), for example, you would just log in and retrieve your settings, rather than start from scratch on a new computer. Unfortunately, the execution is all effed up.
<br/><br/>
Synapse, the software driving the cloud setup, has both an online and offline mode. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t access the offline portion until you&#39;ve registered your new hardware. This is a problem, especially when the company forcing you to create an account before you can <i>use your mouse</i>&nbsp;can&#39;t keep its servers up.&nbsp;Furthermore, if you&#39;re away from your own computer (with its offline settings synched) and without an internet connection, your mouse becomes useless again. And it&#39;s not just spotty internet connections that cause a problem. It&#39;s also other software.
<blockquote>
<i>If you work somewhere that has a network behind firewalls, chances are even though you can download the Synapse software, the firewall may also block you from activating and using the software as well.</i>
</blockquote>
As for Razer&#39;s suggested workaround ("standard plug and play")? No one spends $80 for a "plug and play" mouse (or over $300 with the keyboard -- which also requires a connection and an account). The <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/synapse2/faq" target="_blank">FAQ for Synapse</a> (required going forward for Razer&#39;s products) suggests that once your setup is complete, moving between online and offline modes will be a "seamless experience." The definition of "seamless" seems to vary from person to person.
<blockquote>
<i>If your connection drops out for any reason, the Synapse software will make a habit of locking up on you while it transitions to offline mode. During that time your settings may revert or possibly not be saved.</i>
</blockquote>
Google disagrees with Razer&#39;s definition of "seamless" as well. Searching for "Razer Synapse" autosuggests the following, which hardly inspires confidence.

<br/>
<a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/pc-peripheral/3408738/razer-deathstalker-ultimate-elite-keyboard-review/" target="_blank">Reviews of Razer hardware requiring Synapse</a> haven&#39;t been too kind either (at least not to the software). Here&#39;s what the person shelling out nearly $400 for just a Razer keyboard has in store for them:
<blockquote>
<i>As of this writing the Razer Synapse driver software is easy to download and frustrating to use. Conceptually, it&#39;s great: download Synapse and create a free Razer account, then customize your peripherals and your settings will be saved to Razer servers automatically, meaning you can take your Razer gear anywhere and simply download Synapse to have access to your custom configuration. In practice, Synapse runs slowly and sports an unintuitive interface.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>Most frustrating of all, during testing Synapse had a hard time reliably detecting Razer peripherals; while testing the DeathStalker Ultimate I had to install Razer Synapse three times across three different PCs, and each time I had problems convincing the software that I had in fact connected our review keyboard. I was able to solve the problem on all of our test machines by either rebooting the PC or reinstalling the software, but it was always a headache.</i>
</blockquote>
Fun stuff. All this hassle for a "seamless experience." Min-Liang Tan of Razer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/minliangtan/posts/439763436081444" target="_blank">had this to say in defense of the Synapse software</a> (via a Facebook post):
<blockquote>
<i>We invented onboard memory for gaming mice many years ago and called it Synapse to allow gamers to bring their profiles with them on the go. However, we realized that we ran into another issue where we had to keep increasing the amount of memory onboard to provide for more storage and this resulted in higher and higher prices for gamers.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>We then invented Synapse 2.0 where we could provide almost limitless amount of storage for profiles, macros, etc in the cloud as opposed to being limited by physical memory.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>We wanted to avoid raising prices to gamers for higher memory space onboard (think about it like having to buy bigger and bigger hard drives as opposed to having all your storage on the cloud) and provide a much better service for our users.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>Synapse 2.0 is NOT DRM. Our products work perfectly well out of the box without Synapse 2.0. Synapse 2.0 provides ADDITIONAL functionality of almost limitless memory in the cloud as opposed to taking away functionality (which is what DRM is).</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>We recognize that gamers will want to be able to use their gear without an online connection, and that&#39;s why Synapse 2.0 has an OFFLINE mode. Basically you have to register, create an account, save your initial settings and if you so prefer, you can stay in offline mode all the time without going online.</i>
<br/><br/>
<i>I realize that we have had issues with the activation server, and we&#39;re making sure we get that sorted out.</i>
</blockquote>
First off, it would appear that Razer&#39;s products <i>don&#39;t</i> work perfectly well out of the box, seeing as they require activation and a registered account before settings can be tweaked. They make work as well as much, much cheaper plug-and-play peripherals but people don&#39;t buy Razer devices with the intention of using them like a $10 Kensington vanilla mouse. Second, claiming <i>additional</i> functionality is a bit rich when the software itself is too flaky to guarantee this additional functionality. "Limitless memory in the cloud" is only as good as the software connecting it to the user and, so far, it looks like Synapse 2.0 isn&#39;t getting it done reliably.
<br/><br/>
Third, while it&#39;s true that Synapse has an offline mode, it&#39;s completely unusable until everything else has been connected via registration. It would be preferable to have a choice <i>before</i> all the extra steps (register, create account, save settings, etc.), rather than be forced to utilize the <i>online</i> version <i>first</i>. (One helpful user of Overclock.net has <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1320903/razer-synapse-2-0-offline-saved-settings-and-login-for-offline-pcs" target="_blank">helpfully posted a <i>real</i> workaround</a> that allows Razer purchasers to use their peripherals and preferred settings, rather than settling for plug-and-play limitations.)
<br/><br/>
Last, if internal storage is so expensive, why are competitors able to keep their peripheral prices in line with Razer&#39;s while still offering the same options and functions? If the price is an object, why not give users the option to store their settings on something else equally portable, like a USB drive?
<br/><br/>
And then there&#39;s the data harvesting. This post at Overclock.net <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1323093/razer-razer-synapse-2-0-used-for-always-on-data-mining" target="_blank">goes on at great length about Synapse&#39;s terms of service</a> even though there&#39;s nothing really unusual about them. Razer wants as much data as it can get ahold of, much like any other company or online service. The difference here is that registration is <i>forced</i>, with the device pretty much held hostage until the purchaser jumps through all the hoops, hopefully dropping lots of usable information along the way.
<br/><br/>
Registration for computer hardware is nothing new, but for the most part, people could just indefinitely delay the process if they so chose, or eliminate it completely. I&#39;ve installed hard drives, DVD writers, printers, etc., all of which asked me to register and voluntarily hand over personally identifiable information. Whether I did this or not <i>had no effect</i> on my usage of these products. Sure, anyone can fill out a form with a bunch of fake information, but Razer will still collect usage data and specific computer information from every computer it comes in contact with. Bringing your mouse with you to a LAN party and downloading the Synapse to access your settings just gives Razer more data to work with.
<br/><br/>
While some people are referring to this internet-connection-required aspect as "DRM," it really isn&#39;t. What it <i>is</i> though, is a consumer-unfriendly choice. If your customers are going to shell out $300+ for a keyboard, wouldn&#39;t you think they deserve more than one badly implemented "option?"
<br/><br/>
Perhaps its Razer&#39;s lack of an online help forum that has shielded it (until now) from the complaints of Synapse users. Sure, it has an email address for technical support, but most people probably consider that a last-ditch option at best and a customer service black hole at worst.
<br/><br/>
Bottom line: people <i>loathe</i> software that requires internet access to use. Pushing Synapse going forward doesn&#39;t necessarily make Razer a bad company, but the insistence that users log in and register&nbsp;<i>first</i> certainly plays right into its desire to collect information on its customers. Compounding this misstep with a party line that basically states "Synapse is great and works great" is a large step in the wrong direction. Razer claims to crafting a better user experience, but perhaps it should actually listen to its users, rather than telling them what they&#39;ll like and getting defensive when users express their displeasure.</div>

In this case, if you buy this mouse to use with one gaming computer that never leaves your house... you still have to register it to get it to work properly. WTF?<br/>

All they needed to do to avoid this problem is to provide an option to store settings locally *or* upload them to the cloud for portability. This is not hard, and the fact they don't offer this capability makes their attempted justifications of the software as being for the benefit of the user self-evidently BS.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=22#addyourcomment" cid="22" subject="...for no good reason" cid="22" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_22" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c22">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c22">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">Unless ths app REQUIRES internet - having it depend on the internet is one good way of keeping me from buying it.<br/>
<br/>
I got burnt good by 'Square Enix' on a game called Supreme Commander 2 - the box I bought (yes, bought a physical DVD) said NOTHING about it requiring an internet connection to play...<br/>
<br/>
Normally I have one, but I bought a game BECAUSE my internet was out for a weekend - that REALLY annoyed me. I won't buy a game from them anymore - once I did get internet, it required me to download another Gig of data - the DVD had like 2 GB free - WTF?<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't a patch - it was content you HAD to download to play the version on the DVD - it really annoyed me bad.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I get burnt with that - it's just the principle.<br/>

instead of razer. I have mates that have razor items and havnt had this issue(thank gawd!) and love the produce, normally im a logitech man myself. <br/>
<br/>
This is beyond rediculas though, do these people not even think of people who have to travel often(like me!) - yes a gaming mouse isnt always needed when i travel but i like my damn keyboard and mouse, and i WILL bring those buggers with me(honestly ive actually left some items behind FOR my KB/Mouse hookup on my laptop before - yes i know a laptop has a KB, but try coding on one compared to a kb your comforable with haha).<br/>
<br/>
Razor, in the only way an aussie could honestly say it - dickheads, how about thinking first?

<div class="cbody">I had made a purchase of the Star Wars Old Republic mouse from Razer and was forced to use this crappy software when it was still technically deemed a beta. My experience with it was absolutely awful. From the software crashing to freezing up, to not detecting my mouse, to losing my settings when it was unplugged (wireless mode), to telling me my serial number wasn't valid.<br/>
I couldn't get any help from support so I returned the mouse. This was my second experience with a Razer mouse. The first one had similar problems with their software (the Synapse 1 software) and it would frequently stop detecting my mouse, revert settings, and take 10-20 seconds to detect after switching modes.<br/>
I'm done with Razer as a company. Logitech has never done me wrong.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=199#addyourcomment" cid="199" subject="" cid="199" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_199" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c199">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c199">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re:</h3><div class="cbody">Infact lets get this straight, using napkin-figures. <br/>
<br/>
What possible settings do you have? lets say, 18 pre-sets(i know more than it has but hey work with me here), plus DPI, scroll rate - can anyone think of more. <br/>
<br/>
so 18 key pre-sets, 2 key combinations, each key is what , worstcase scenario 1kb(this is amazingly over what its required btw).<br/>
<br/>
so were looking at 18KB plus DPI/Scroll, lets be REALLY generous and say there's another 2kb there. 20KB<br/>
<br/>
20KB.<br/>
<br/>
ill let this sink in once more<br/>
<br/>
20KB.<br/>
<br/>
im sorry i have to ONCE MORE<br/>
<br/>
20KB. I honestly think i could program this for under 500 bytes - but i havnt worked with that sort of storage for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Are they "honestly" trying to say that onboard storage is that expensive that they are required to use an always on connection to support their mouse settings?<br/>
<br/>
You could multiply my own base calculations by 100 and still burst the data upstream in bugger all time, definatly NOT requiring an always on connection.<br/>
<br/>
My next question would be... what are they transmitting to their servers???</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=413#addyourcomment" cid="413" subject="Re:" cid="413" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_413" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c413">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c413">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<br/>
DPI switching is done via hardware buttons that don't need the internet. <br/>
<br/>
The software is next to useless even without the internet activation. A third-party macro program like AHK is superior in nearly every instance.<br/>

I agree with the notion that Synapse is terrible, both in concept (internet activation) and execution.

Another gripe around this:<br/>
<br/>
Home broadband routers/firewalls that require an Internet connection to configure them. This is SO brain-dead that I think someone should get an award from the Internet security version of the Darwin Awards.<br/>
<br/>
I used to configure network equipment BEFORE installing it. Through the handy little serial port connection that isn't being provided any more. Avoids all the pain and stress associated with a router that INSISTS on being at IP 192.168.0.1 regardless of what subnet it is sitting on. I remember some equipment that used to let you set its address with hardware selectors. Why, yes, thank you, I would like to reconfigure at least one node on my network to accomodate your skinflint marketing department's wishes.<br/>

<br/>
Remote command sets don't really change that much generation to generation and manufactureres tend to use similar sets on later equipment, which is why the old "number code for manufacturer" multi-remotes worked even on later equipment (with maybe some errors for new features. More than that on the remote you <i> can</i><i> create them manually... except you </i> <i> can't</i> without the internet connection.<br/>
So if Harmony decide to do it another way and stop supporting the server, or if they go bust, or even if their database suddenly becomes incompatible with your model remote due to a schema update demanded by some "improvement" they've made, the next time you change out a piece of equipment your expensive multi-remote turns into an expensive brick when it should be (and in fact <i> is</i>) capable of supporting any command set.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1009#addyourcomment" cid="1009" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re:" cid="1009" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1009" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1009">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1009">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<br/>
1. Once you have setup your remote there's no need to connect again unless your going to be adding a new device or deleting one. The last time i need to connect my remote to the internet was five months ago when i added my WDTV Live.<br/>
<br/>
2. There's probably ten's of thousand devices on that database and it's easier for them to add,and change entries then create a never ending files for download. One device i bought over two years ago had the wrong info for the control over the device, one phone to the customer support and they made the change to support it and now anyone the got the same device would be getting the new control info.<br/>
<br/>
My harmony one controls my ac, clock radio, av receiver, tv, cable box, wdtv live, and xbox 360</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1018#addyourcomment" cid="1018" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re:" cid="1018" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1018" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1018">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1018">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<br/>
However, there is an argument against my point. I was unaware of this until I did a little research today: Logitech has a mouse with a similar form factor to the Naga. If you can get the same functionality and quality without the bad software then the choice to purchase a Naga despite Synapse gets much less attractive.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1179#addyourcomment" cid="1179" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: This is just incorrect" cid="1179" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1179" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1179">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1179">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

This must be accessed using the software and the software <i> requires</i> internet.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of what you say is mostly true and there is indeed a valid reason for an internet connection and that it works in this way is a great feature, but the fact remains that it should not be mandatory for basic functionality. <br/>
<br/>
If manual config worked locally as you suggest I wouldn't have a problem because then the remote would learn and work if I choose to spend the effort teaching it for as long as devices use IR remotes. As it stands however Harmony, and not I, have control of how long I get to use <i> my</i> device for and that is wrong.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1201#addyourcomment" cid="1201" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re:" cid="1201" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1201" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1201">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1201">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

Don't really care if they know what type of devices or who the manufactures are, just don't want them tracking what I'm using it for or how many times i use said devices. Since its been very long stretch in between connections I highly don't there tracking anything. If they had me connecting every couple weeks for no reason then you might have a point.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re:</h3><div class="cbody">My last post on this matter, we are both right and wrong on certain things. WaCKO started this by saying that Logitech isn't any better than Razor with it's internet connection for its remotes. It is still comparing apples to oranges, Razor is constantly polling to setup a two way communication process to gather info about your usage(system and internet) and give it to them. You have no real control over this and this process interferes with your everyday usage of their products with or without Internet access. What makes it even worse that they want to sell that info, and there's nothing stating it or the constant need to connect to the net on the packaging.<br/>
<br/>
You do need an internet connection to setup on configure the Harmony.I have owned the Harmony One since September of 09, since my initial setup and configuration I have only needed to connect my remote to the net six times till now. Those times i have connected have been to add new devices, change channel info(channel numbers &amp; Icons). I'm not a big macro guy and my setup is pretty simple. It sucks that when you tried to connect you had issues, stuff happens but once your setup your basically done, and not required to keep connecting to the Internet like Razor products.

The whole discussion over the Logitech Harmony is red herring within red herring squared. Their solution is not perfect and I don't think they are making it to be one. I'm no expert but i have owned Philips(they also had software for palm) and Marantz learning remotes close to a decade ago and harmony's solution to the issues that plagued those system blew them out of the water. The Philips remotes are the most tragic as you could design your own UI for those remotes. Many made some spectacular UI's for those remotes, that you could freely download and many people tried to maintain device databases but it was an extreme cluster f**k.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1466#addyourcomment" cid="1466" subject="Re: Mindless misdirection" cid="1466" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1466" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1466">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1466">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

I have (and still do) on a daily basis. I do not use Synapse and never have. Other than "saving my profiles to the cloud" there is zero functionality that Synapse provides that is not also available either through free third-party programs or native Windows functionality. <br/>
<br/>
I can create macros. I can save profiles. I can remap all the buttons. I can swap DPI. And I have an accurate and responsive device that provides a much better experience than a "cheap mouse without software".<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY functionality that is not available without Synapse - cloud-storage profiles - necessarily requires an internet connection and an account, rendering the complaint about online activation moot. <br/>

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re:</h3><div class="cbody">My last post on this bit too.... I agree with almost everything you said. The Harmony remote is basically a good bit of kit and works well once set up and yes you don't really need to change it <i> that</i> often, BUT (and here's where I disagree) the key point is not how intrusive the requirement is, but that it is a requirement at all when it does not have to be.<br/>
Like the Razer, the Harmony <i> does not work as it should</i> unless you have an internet connection, which makes it a valid conparison. There's no reason for that no matter how you slice it. Like the Harmony it appears that you can't use the Razer "offline" mode (for remote read using the remote once programmed) without an initial internet connection and there's no good reason for that on the Harmony unless you happen to have a device newer than the last production run - operating systems seem to manage just fine for example including "default drivers" for most devices. The remote ships with a CD - how hard would it be to include the latest DB at time of production run on it and update <i> that</i> with the internet connection? <br/>
<br/>
Is it as intrusive? No, I agree with you there, but it's the same principle. Bottom line is that I got the remote as a gift and in operation I love it, but if I were spending my own money on it they wouldn't have a customer because of this feature, which was the point of the article. <br/>
<br/>
This kind of control strikes me as a general corporate disease of imagined control and my guess is that if wireless/cell networking were a ubiquitous "given", that the Logitec requirement would be just as intrusive as the Razer. The "user convenience" arguments ring hollow when there are easy ways to do it without the always on connection and when "user choice" is removed.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1524#addyourcomment" cid="1524" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re:" cid="1524" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1524" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1524">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1524">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re:</h3><div class="cbody">This is why, even when I buy legit, boxed games, I go find and install a crack anyway. And I buy quite a few. Right now, I have 24 games installed, and I have boxes for 19 of them sitting on the shelf above my desk right this very moment, all legally bought at full price. The other 5 I've had for less than 2 weeks. Unless something changes, I'll be buying two of them (Borderlands 2 and Dishonored) on Saturday after I get my patcheck, and I'll simply delete the other 3 and never see them again. I call this a self-imposed 14 day trial, and to date I've only ever violated this once (and then a friend bought me Minecraft so that corrected that situation.)<br/>
<br/>
But back to the point, guess how many of those 19 boxes I bought I've ever opened? Zero. None. Notta. For all 19 of those games, I'm still running the copy I pirated. They have no bugs, no DRM, and no steam (yes I know that's repetitive since steam IS DRM, but many people don't see it that way...) I never have a game magically disappear because some dumbass running a cloud server doesn't THINK I bought it. I never get kicked off multiplayer because I have singleplayer cheats enabled (I'm looking at you, ME3 - and yes, I only have cheats enabled that don't effect multiplayer anyway, i.e. all items in stores, etc.) And yet, I still support games and the companies who make them, with my wallet - I just don't support the asshats they outsource their DRM to.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1560#addyourcomment" cid="1560" subject="Re:" cid="1560" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1560" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1560">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1560">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">Honest view? While the hardware designers at Razer do rather good work, their software people would, if combined, perhaps have half the brainpower of a rock.<br/>
This whole fiasco doesn't surprise me that much--being a lefty, I bought their Lefthanded Deathadder a while back. The mouse itself is great for a low-end gaming mouse..but the driver has a rather critical problem in it. For some reason, (at least for me, anyway) it craps itself if you try to take the simple measure of swapping the functions of the LMB and RMB. (I'm weird, I guess--I'm a southpaw, but have used right-handed and ambi mice so long that I'd rather use the 'standard' LMB/left-click, RMB/right-click setup than the supposedly 'lefty' reversed setup). This might not be a problem, except that half the games I own bother to check the Windows setting for reversing the buttons, and the other half apparenty go straight to the mouse driver--and it's highly annoying trying to rememeber which game does which. Support response was BS on what's pretty obviously a driver bug--at one point they were insisting I needed to send the entire mouse back...*on my own dime*.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly--I'd just about beg Logitech to make a lefty gaming mouse, so I'd be able to wash my hands of Razer entirely--I have Logitech gamepads for PC and console, and more than a few of the ambi mice I've had to use were Logitech, so I know their stuff *works*. But I want something designed for the hand I use to game with, not just some ambi..</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1621#addyourcomment" cid="1621" subject="" cid="1621" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1621" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1621">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1621">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<br/>
Hey Razer, get a clue. <br/>
<br/>
- The user may not want to install the synch software on his system. Don't force it. Install the drivers and the local software only. Or have the software be in a local-only mode, your choice.<br/>
- If the synch software isn't there (or is disabled), save locally.<br/>
- If the user doesn't have an account, pretend he's not connected and save locally.<br/>
- If the user has an account but isn't online, save locally.<br/>
- Save locally FIRST. THEN check to see if he's enabled the synch, is online, and has an account. If all are true, THEN synchronize.<br/>
<br/>
The online synch should be a feature ADDED TO your peripheral software, not the other way around. If you can't learn that, you need to not be in business.<br/>
<br/>
Please note: I was actually interested in buying a Razer mouse until I read this. (Oh, and I just received a bit of extra disposable income.) Now? Not. (I'm sure I'll find something else to spend it on.

So, obviously, you don't own, nor have ever owned a Rev. 1.0 G15 where:<br/>
<b>1)</b> the "soft plastic" coating breaks over time in warm climate zones and goes all sticky, requiring you to purchase 99% isopropyl alcohol to strip the entire surface back to the base plastic.<br/>
<b>2)</b> Where the paint on the keys rubs off so you can't see the lettering.<br/>
<b>3)</b> Where the back-light flickers for no reason.<br/>
<b>4)</b> Where the fancy LED Game Panel screen develops lines through it and never had enough support, so there were virtually zero functioning apps for it.<br/>
<b>5)</b> Where the software is so bloated it actually required 5 or 6 separate processes to run in the background to support the keyboard and,<br/>
<b>6)</b> where, over time, some of the keys, not being mechanical, just cease to function at all?<br/>
<br/>
My friend bought a Rev. 2.0 G15 after he saw mine, but before the problems really became inherent. His died well before mine did. So, I don't see how you can laud Logitech and their "no frills" hardware, when the produce some of the crappiest quality stuff with all the supposed "bells &amp; whistles". Maybe your budget $20 Logitech keyboard works, for now, but their "gaming" products leave much to be desired.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, all the paint is coming off my G5 Laser mouse, it's "soft plastic" coating degraded jsut like the keyboard, and my Z-5500 5.1 speakers crackle randomly.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=1949#addyourcomment" cid="1949" subject="Re: Re:" cid="1949" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1949" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c1949">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c1949">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

The Harmony database has config files for over 500,000 different AV devices, and they update that list constantly for both new devices coming to market and older devices submitted by request of its users.<br/>
<br/>
There's a difference between a few personal settings on a mouse, and 500,000 AV device settings.<br/>
<br/>
<i>"What about allowing the option, but also allowing you to <b> download</b>"</i><br/>

Word to the wise, you must be connected to the internet to download stuff. Again, why would you download a 500,000+ entry database just for your half a dozen devices?<br/>
<br/>
Not that I'm defending Logitech here. I'm an antenna technician and AV installer, and personally, the Logitech Harmony software and install process are a joke. Installing these in the field is painful, since the presets for devices in the Harmony database are sometimes incomplete, so features have to be manually programmed (like the "music" button on a Foxtel/Austar remote.

Steam is a service. There's a difference. Sure, Steam pass on 3rd party publisher's DRM, but they are required to or those publishers wouldn't release their games on Steam, and the community would be worse off for it.<br/>

I suppose you could make the argument that you can't play a Valve game without Steam, and that's probably somewhat valid, But Steam is an integral part of Valve's games, and Steam itself, does have an offline mode.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=2076#addyourcomment" cid="2076" subject="Re: Re:" cid="2076" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_2076" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c2076">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c2076">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re:</h3><div class="cbody">Yeah, Logitech pretty much turned me off of their "gaming" products after they discontinued the venerable MX-510 mouse.<br/>
<br/>
My old rev 2.0 G15 had some of the mushiest, least tactile keys I've ever felt on a keyboard. I'm currently using a cheap Dell keyboard that came with the computer that it's currently attached to and it gives a considerably better typing experience. At least that revision did something about the hilariously dim backlighting of the original G15, but the quality was diminished in every other conceivable way.<br/>
<br/>
The original G5 was okay, with one notable exception that made it virtually unusable for games: the scroll wheel was a complete pile of crap. When mine was just outside of the return period, it started double and triple triggering, which made selecting weapons in FPS titles incredibly difficult. After a while, it began to trigger at the slightest touch. To make matters worse, the wheel button was so hard to press that half of the time doing a middle-click would cause you to jog the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
I would put it down to me getting unlucky and getting a bad mouse, but I know two other people who bought a G5 and they had the exact same issues with it.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I have been pleased with my Z-2200 speakers. I also have a fairly recent trackball from them that has proven to be a solid performer (and it doesn't have any scroll wheel issues, like every single one of Logitech's gaming mice seem to quickly develop). I also have an old Logitech Elite keyboard that I've beaten the hell out of (after retiring it from normal use I used it as a shop keyboard, so it's been moved a lot and suffered an accidental drop or two) and despite that I haven't had any issues with it. Logitech is great as long as you stay far away from their gaming products.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=2347#addyourcomment" cid="2347" subject="Re: Re: Re:" cid="2347" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_2347" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c2347">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c2347">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: This is just incorrect</h3><div class="cbody">Not quite. Perhaps you haven't used their legacy driver in contrast with their Synapse 2.0. I have an, let me tell you, it's night and day with performance. You can still download the legacy driver for most of their mice. And it starts up so much faster you'll be shocked. Synapse takes a while to start and in the meantime, my Razer mouse's settings were completely screwed up (vanilla?) until it Synapse loaded, then downloaded something (I know this because my hardware Firewall is telling me it is), then the mouse would respond normally with my settings. However that during that time of loading when Windows is free to use, my mice would respond very strangely.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I went back to the legacy drivers for all three of the Razer mice my family uses. I've been a customer since the Razer Bloomslang and if they don't get rid of this cloud nonsense and restore offline always reliability to their drivers, I'm switching companies for me and my family. It really is that simple. I can't believe I even have to take the time and write a post about a mouse.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=2383#addyourcomment" cid="2383" subject="Re: This is just incorrect" cid="2383" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_2383" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c2383">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c2383">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

If so, then yes, that's the one I use. There's also third party software once can use to interact with the mouse. Either way, I agree with John's assertions.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Flash memory</h3><div class="cbody">I had an idea about a decade ago for a little bit of flash memory inside a mouse which would store the mouse's settings. That way, if you moved the mouse to a different system, it would still retain your settings. You could configure the mouse's settings though a settings screen on the computer which would write the settings out to the flash memory within the mouse itself.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to get a patent for this through the company I worked for at the time, but they said it was not worthy of a patent. However, after reading this article, that would solve the problems of having to "activate" the mouse and of storing the settings "in the cloud". But then the mouse company would not get to play Big Brother with its customers, either.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?cid=2397#addyourcomment" cid="2397" subject="Flash memory" cid="2397" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_2397" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml#c2397">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20121105/17594020942/when-mouse-requires-internet-connection-youre-doing-cloud-wrong.shtml?threaded=true#c2397">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody">As someone who's just bought a Logitech G27 and found it one of the most well-designed and easy-to-setup peripherals I've ever used, this debacle makes me laugh.<br/>

Also, Corsair peripherals FTW. I didn't even bother installing the software for my M60 for about two months, because I rarely use many key bindings and the hardware DPI adjustment/Sniper mode worked perfectly straight out of the box. When I did install, it took five minutes.<br/>

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Sue them for violations of MM Warranty Act</h3><div class="cbody">Why sue them into the ground? Return the mouse if you don't like it and let Razor know you don't approve of their practices. But if you like the mouse and everything that goes with it and you are just upset you were unaware of the connection being needed<br/>
<br/>
well this sounds like something a company like Razor would like to know about and would fix down the road. <br/>
