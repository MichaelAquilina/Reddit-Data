<h1 class="posttitle">Office Depot Sends World&#39;s Worst DMCA Notice To Reddit</h1><h3>from the <i>the-non-swastika-is-the-least-of-your-problems</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
I'm always amazed when lawyers send clearly bogus DMCA notices. It shouldn't be hard to figure out that doing so ends badly. I'm doubly surprised, however, when it comes from big companies that should know better. And, I'm quadruple surprised when one of these companies that should know better sends a completely bogus DMCA notice to a company that absolutely understands why the notice is bogus, and is also in a position to make the world know all about a company's bogus DMCA notice. That's what we have here. You see, this morning, Office Depot decided to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/816025-dmca-reddit-hesienber69-infringement-office.html">send a DMCA to Reddit</a>.
<br/><br/>
Yes, to Reddit.
<br/><br/>
Now, yes, it's possible that someone posted copyrighted material to Reddit, for which a DMCA could possibly be appropriate. But this isn't one of those cases. The complaint is about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1bric3/" target="_blank">this r/circlejerk post</a> by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/heisenberg69" target="_blank">heisenberg69</a> from seven months ago. I imagine that post isn't going anywhere, but just in case it is, I've also embedded the screenshot that Office Depot helpfully included with the DMCA notice to Reddit. As you can see, heisenberg69 posted a link to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/l04llDU.png" target="_blank">this imgur image</a> of not-quite a swastika over the Office Depot logo. We'll repost it here for you to see:
<center>
<a href="http://imgur.com/USRrFNF"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/USRrFNFm.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com"/></a>
</center>
Of course, as the first comment points out, this isn't even a swastika. It's a sauwastika, the Buddhist symbol for peace. Basically, it's a <i>backwards</i> swastika. Either way, let's count the many, many, many ways in which this DMCA notice is bogus.
<ol>
<li>This is not copyright infringement. At all. Office Depot's Corporate Counsel Jared Namm appears to admit this at the <i>very beginning</i> of his DMCA notice. While he first says it "violates the copyrights and trademarks of Office Depot," at no point does he explain what copyright is violated, because he can't. He later points only to "the Office Depot trademark." But, you cannot use a DMCA for trademark. It is only for copyright. Pretending to use a DMCA claim for a trademark claim is an abuse of the DMCA.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>Even if you look at the trademark issue, this is not a trademark issue. Making use of a logo in this manner is in no way an infringement on Office Depot's trademark. There is no "use in commerce." There is no likelihood of confusion. And there are many, many, many cases where simply parodying or mocking a logo of a company has been found to be non-infringing. Nazi-izing someone's logo for the purpose of mocking the company is not infringement.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>This is not copyright infringement, part two. After trying out the bogus trademark claim, Office Depot's Namm claims that the posting is in violation of Reddit's terms of service. Even if this were true, that's not a reason to send a DMCA notice.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>This is not a violation of Reddit's terms of service. Again, even if you could send a DMCA based on a violation of the terms of service, this is not a violation of the terms of service. Office Depot argues that this is "defamatory, abusive, harassing, racist, hateful or violent." I guess you could try to make an argument for "hateful," but it's difficult to see how that reaches the level of a terms of service violation.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>Merely mocking a company such as Office Depot for having Nazi-like attributes is not hate speech. It may not make much sense, but that's not how it works. It's even more ridiculous when you realize this isn't even a swastika. Amazingly, even Office Depot <i>admits this</i> in the DMCA letter, which Namm adds as if it's a helpful tidbit:
<blockquote><i>
A little history on the symbol as well: this particular design is not Nazi related but the original Sauwastika (facing left) vs. the Nazi Germany alteration (facing right). The left facing has been a symbol in Hindu/Buddhist art/texts that predate the Nazi usage by centuries. While this does not dismiss the use of the symbol in conjunction with our logo, in reviewing the posts it appears there is confusion on the symbol, but heisenberg69's posting of the symbol over the Office Depot logo associates Office Depot with Nazi Germany.
</i></blockquote>
So, Office Depot admits this isn't a Nazi symbol, and sends a screenshot in which the top comment, with the most votes on the thread, is pointing out that this isn't a Nazi symbol... and then still says this posting associates Office Depot with Nazis.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>Jared Namm swore "under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed." Yet, despite mentioning copyright, nowhere does he name an actual copyright that's been infringed, because there hasn't been one. While he may be able to skate out from under perjury by arguing that the second half of that penalty of perjury clause was "owner of an exclusive right," again no trademark law has been infringed and you can't use the DMCA for trademark anyway. It's not wise to swear under penalty of perjury to something that is almost certainly not true.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>The image is not hosted on Reddit. But on Imgur. Which is a different company.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>Oh yeah, and this was a Reddit r/circlejerk post <b>from 7 months ago</b> that didn't get that much attention then and has all but disappeared from view entirely. And now, due entirely to the absolutely stupid decision by either Office Depot Corporate Counsel Jared Namm, or someone above him in management who told him to do this and who failed to heed any suggestion that this was (a) not infringement and (b) a monumentally stupid move, he went ahead and sent this notice, practically guaranteeing that the post and the image would suddenly get renewed life and attention.
<br/><br/>
</li><li>And, finally, sending a totally bogus DMCA notice <i>to Reddit</i>? Reddit, who as a community was perhaps the <i>most instrumental</i> community in bringing down SOPA, has no love for bogus copyright claims. Remember, Reddit is the community who organized the massive GoDaddy boycott that got GoDaddy to back down from its support of SOPA (and to eventually turn over almost its entire management team). Poking Reddit with a bogus DMCA stick for what appears to be no reason at all just doesn't seem smart at all.
</li></ol>
Incredibly, Jared Namm's <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredblakenamm" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> claims that he advises Office Depot on a variety of intellectual property <b>and social media</b> initiatives. I would imagine that picking a bogus fight with Reddit is not exactly the wisest of "social media" strategies.<center>

<h3 class="commentsubject">I hate this revisionist history crap!</h3><div class="cbody">There is no such thing as a 'bad' or a 'good' swastika. There never was a distinction in India of left or right facing. All such variations were good luck.<br/><br/>A long time ago, someone who wasn't fully informed said there was a thing called a suawastika, we learned that wasn't true, but this continues today as a common misconception and needs a concerted effort to stamp out. And this is all because we're uncomfortable about the atrocities committed by the nazi regime!<br/><br/>Please just read Wikipedia for god's sake! It explains everything! You can clearly see that the distinction of left and right facing swasticas is wrong.<br/><br/>Furthermore I will take this chance to mention that the symbol we call a swastica was a good luck symbol in Europe before the nazi party, a good luck symbol in India, a significant symbol to a tribe of native Americans who chose to abandon its use after World War II in respect for the evils perpetrated by the nazi party and has been used by many and very disparate groups for thousands of years! We cannot take the fact of what that symbol was to so many out of our history simply because once upon a time some bad people used it to try for good luck, which is the reason the nazi party adopted the symbol.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131106/11130125151/office-depot-sends-worlds-worst-dmca-notice-to-reddit.shtml?cid=556#addyourcomment" cid="556" subject="I hate this revisionist history crap!" cid="556" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_556" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131106/11130125151/office-depot-sends-worlds-worst-dmca-notice-to-reddit.shtml#c556">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131106/11130125151/office-depot-sends-worlds-worst-dmca-notice-to-reddit.shtml?threaded=true#c556">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">a lot of times it's just about billable hours</h3><div class="cbody">It's a stupid untenable take down notice, BUT it generates billable hours for the law firm, which no doubt will bill Office Depot for all its "hours" spent finding to so-called violation and composing the weak DMCA.<br/><br/>I think people don't appreciate how a lot of the bogus DMCA and other legal stuff are just about generating billable hours. To me, baseless legal threats etc should cause the offending attorney to be debarred after X instances. <br/> <br/> This reminds me so much of other fee-generating licensed professions, such as stock brokers who churn and hedge fund's with fees so high their victim clients would have made lots more money with simple Vanguard low-fee index funds.<br/><br/>Such bogus DMCA and other bogus legal threat letters should at least trigger notifications the lawyer's client that his or her lawyer/law firm is billing them for no good reason.<br/><br/>I think billing for civil law work is out of control.<br/><br/>Two property developers I know recently finished cases in which the lawyers took ALL or nearly all of the money from the verdict/settlement to cover legal fees for the case. In one case, a condo complex really only needed $10k from the developer to fix a sewage system problem but instead believed a lawyer who persuaded the condo assoc to sue the developer for $1 million. The condo assoc won the $1 million but the lawfirm took ALL of it, leaving the condo complex without even the $10k fix for the sewage problem, which the developer had offered gratis before the case. Another developer I know bought a high-rise building and sued the seller for $600k and won, but his lawyer's fees were $500k!<br/><br/>Hedge funds and other financial pros also mostly rip off their clients, as do so many civil lawyers who don't care if their cases settle or lose in trial as long as they get to bill invoice for billable hours.<br/><br/>Lawyers, hedge fund managers, stock brokers: fee whores who make money off their clients win, lose or bust.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20131106/11130125151/office-depot-sends-worlds-worst-dmca-notice-to-reddit.shtml?cid=581#addyourcomment" cid="581" subject="a lot of times it's just about billable hours" cid="581" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_581" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131106/11130125151/office-depot-sends-worlds-worst-dmca-notice-to-reddit.shtml#c581">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20131106/11130125151/office-depot-sends-worlds-worst-dmca-notice-to-reddit.shtml?threaded=true#c581">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">The Copyright Infringement Claim is Legitimate</h3><div class="cbody">The DMCA takedown notice appears to be made in good faith. Most attorneys would presume that the logo you see was lifted from the OfficeMax website or another property. It appears that the swastika was drawn on top of the logo, which doesn't change the nature of the fact that the use of an OfficeMax image is still infringement. That's how you get to the DMCA.<br/><br/>The extra items added in was a way of informing the company about the violations of its terms of use to make it easier for Reddit to take down the offending image. While I am completely into the rights of free speech, I can understand why OfficeMax isn't happy and felt a need to do something about it. I'm apprehensive to say this, wondering how many will get angry at what I'm saying. How many of you would want to have images of your own small company's brand with a swastika on it being seen anywhere? People might get the wrong idea. I'm sure many would even write to Office Depot complaining about the company adding a swastika on their logo, lol. Seen it before - it's all in the realm of possibility!
