<h1 class="posttitle">No, A &#39;Supercomputer&#39; Did <b>NOT</b> Pass The Turing Test For The First Time And Everyone Should Know Better</h1><h3>from the <i>what-a-waste-of-time</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
So, this weekend's news in the tech world was flooded with a "story" about how a "chatbot" passed the Turing Test for "the first time," with lots of publications buying every point in the story and talking about what a big deal it was. Except, almost everything about the story is bogus and a bunch of gullible reporters ran with it, because that's what they do. First, here's <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR583836.aspx" target="_blank">the press release from the University of Reading</a>, which should have set off all sorts of alarm bells for any reporter. Here are some quotes, almost all of which are misleading or bogus:
<blockquote><i>
The 65 year-old iconic Turing Test was passed for the very first time by supercomputer Eugene Goostman during Turing Test 2014 held at the renowned Royal Society in London on Saturday.
<br/><br/>
'Eugene', a computer programme that simulates a 13 year old boy, was developed in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The development team includes Eugene's creator Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian born Eugene Demchenko who now lives in Russia.
<br/><br/>
[....] If a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a series of five minute keyboard conversations it passes the test. No computer has ever achieved this, until now. Eugene managed to convince 33% of the human judges that it was human.
</i></blockquote>
Okay, almost everything about the story is bogus. Let's dig in:
<ol>
<li>It's not a "supercomputer," it's a chatbot. It's a <i>script</i> made to mimic human conversation. There is no intelligence, artificial or not involved. It's just a chatbot.
</li><li>Plenty of other chatbots have similarly claimed to have "passed" the Turing test in the past (often with higher ratings). Here's a story from three years ago about another bot, Cleverbot, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20865-software-tricks-people-into-thinking-it-is-human.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news#.U5W65_ldUhM" target="_blank">"passing" the Turing Test</a> by convincing 59% of judges it was human (much higher than the 33% Eugene Goostman) claims.
</li><li>It "beat" the Turing test here by "gaming" the rules -- by telling people the computer was a <a href="http://io9.com/a-chatbot-has-passed-the-turing-test-for-the-first-ti-1587834715?utm_campaign=socialflow_io9_twitter&utm_source=io9_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow">13-year-old boy from Ukraine</a> in order to mentally explain away odd responses.
</li><li>The "rules" of the Turing test always seem to change. Hell, Turing's <a href="http://psych.utoronto.ca/users/reingold/courses/ai/turing.html" target="_blank">original test</a> was quite different anyway.
</li><li>As Chris Dixon <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/475709304188989440" target="_blank">points out</a>, you don't get to run <i>a single test</i> with judges that you picked and declare you accomplished something. That's just not how it's done. If someone claimed to have created nuclear fusion or cured cancer, you'd wait for some peer review and repeat tests under other circumstances before buying it, right?
</li><li>The whole concept of the Turing Test itself is kind of a joke. While it's fun to think about, creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence. Many in the AI world look on the Turing Test as a needless distraction.
</li></ol>
Oh, and the biggest red flag of all. The event was organized by Kevin Warwick at Reading University. If you've spent any time at all in the tech world, you should automatically have red flags raised around that name. Warwick is somewhat infamous for his ridiculous claims to the press, which gullible reporters repeat without question. He's been doing it for decades. All the way back in 2000, we were writing about all the ridiculous press he got for claiming to be the world's first "cyborg" for <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/001006/1156237.shtml">implanting a chip</a> in his arm. There was even a -- since taken down -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040829131505/http://www.kevinwarwick.org.uk/" target="_blank">Kevin Warwick Watch</a> website that mocked and categorized all of his media appearances in which gullible reporters simply repeated all of his nutty claims. Warwick had gone quiet for a while, but back in 2010, we wrote about how his lab was getting bogus press for claiming to have <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100526/1800199593.shtml">"the first human infected with a computer virus."</a> The Register has rightly referred to Warwick as both "Captain Cyborg" and a "media strumpet" and has long been <a href="http://search.theregister.co.uk/?q=kevin+warwick">chronicling his escapades</a> in exaggerating bogus stories about the intersection of humans and computers for many, many years.
<br/><br/>
Basically, any reporter should view extraordinary claims associated with Warwick with extreme caution. But that's not what happened at all. Instead, as is all too typical with Warwick claims, the press went nutty over it, including publications that should know better. Here are just a few sample headlines. The absolute worst are the ones who claim this is a "supercomputer."

Anyway, a lot of hubbub over nothing special that everyone seemed to buy into because of the easy headlines (which is exactly what Warwick always counts on). So, since we just spent all this time on a useless nothing, let's end it with the <a href="http://xkcd.com/329/" target="_blank">obligatory xkcd</a>:

While it's fun to think about, creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence. Many in the AI world look on the Turing Test as a needless distraction."<br/><br/>Well that's just wrong. The only way you can tell whether a person is intelligent or not is by communicating with them. If you interact with a person and they consistently seem to be intelligent, you will conclude they are intelligent. <br/> <br/> If a computer can communicate intelligently, it is intelligent, and if a computer is intelligent, it can communicate intelligently. The chatbot on Star Trek was not reasonable because any chatbot that had that command of the english language would be intelligent and would be able to do a lot of things that the chatbot never did.<br/><br/>In order to create a chatbot that can convince humans that it has human intelligence requires the chatbot to be able to design and write computer programs. It must be able to be given, on the fly, instructions for how to play a simple game, and then be able to play that game. It should be able to critique a recipe for a favorite dish. It needs to be able to analyze and dissect Shakespeare. <br/> <br/> <br/> If people in the AI world view the Turing Test as a needless distraction, it is because those people are concentrating on shorter term problems.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Poorly researched</h3><div class="cbody">This article irritates me a little. There is a strong theme of hate for Professor Kevin Warwick along with poorly researched attempts at debunking.<br/><br/>A quick google will tell you that the event was held in partnership with RoboLaw. The event was aimed toward raising awareness about the ability for a chat bot to convince a human it was a human and how this is very dangerous in the online security arena. For example, you're on your banks website and a chat offering pops up asking you if you need some help. You do, so you click on it. You have a lovely conversation and happily hand over details about your account because you're convinced it's a human on the other end. If that were a robot it now has your details and can do with them as it pleases. This is scary and people need to be made aware of it so they can prepare themselves and be better at identifying possible situations where it might be occurring.<br/><br/>The event was not geared toward some magical development of strong AI overnight, which this author clearly thinks it was trying to claim.<br/><br/>Time to debunk the debunking.<br/><br/>== articles attempt at debunking<br/>- reality check<br/><br/> == "It's not a "supercomputer," it's a chatbot. It's a script made to mimic human conversation. There is no intelligence, artificial or not involved. It's just a chatbot."<br/><br/> - I'm not sure how to answer this. Here code is being compared to hardware performance. For all is known the 'script' could be run on a supercomputer. And since when did being a supercomputer imply AI?!?!?!<br/><br/> == "Plenty of other chatbots have similarly claimed to have "passed" the Turing test in the past (often with higher ratings). Here's a story from three years ago about another bot, Cleverbot, "passing" the Turing Test by convincing 59% of judges it was human (much higher than the 33% Eugene Goostman) claims."<br/><br/> - Just the smallest amount of research will tell you that many other Turing tests restrict the conversation types that are allowed in the testing. This was the first passing of an UNRESTRICTED TURING TEST. This means that the judges were not told in any way that they had to talk about a certain topic. They were literally sat down and told to chat.<br/><br/> == ""beat" the Turing test here by "gaming" the rules -- by telling people the computer was a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine in order to mentally explain away odd responses."<br/><br/> - I'm not sure about the excessive use of quote marks in this debunking. Is the writer afraid to say these words or feels they carry more weight when possibly said by another party? Anyway, yes it was clever that the developer utilised humans willingness to allow increased errors when talking to younger and foreign people. This is just really clever psychology. Can we not just appreciate that? I see no way it is gaming the system, it's just an easier way to pass the test. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective.<br/><br/> == The "rules" of the Turing test always seem to change. Hell, Turing's original test was quite different anyway.<br/><br/> - Welcome to science. Ideas and testing methodologies change over time.<br/><br/> == As Chris Dixon points out, you don't get to run a single test with judges that you picked and declare you accomplished something. That's just not how it's done. If someone claimed to have created nuclear fusion or cured cancer, you'd wait for some peer review and repeat tests under other circumstances before buying it, right?<br/><br/> - Many things wrong with this. There were a total of 350, yes THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY, tests performed on the day of testing. The judges were picked from all age ranges, backgrounds, genders and nationalities to make the testing more fair. There were multiple academics from multiple universities there to specifically monitor the testing methods and ensure all the results were gathered correctly and the results were interpreted correctly. This is peer review.<br/><br/> - If this is not enough peer review for you Dr Huma Shah will be publishing a paper at some point in the future on the event.<br/><br/> == The whole concept of the Turing Test itself is kind of a joke. While it's fun to think about, creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence. Many in the AI world look on the Turing Test as a needless distraction.<br/><br/> - This seems like mostly opinion so I'm not sure how to debunk it. They are right in that it is fun to think about.

I give credit to IBM for not shooting at so trivial a target.<br/><br/>If someone were to design a system expressly to succeed only at the Turing Test, then I'd agree with you that it would be as simple as is needed to win. But that would be a terrible waste of effort if the greater goal were to advance the science of AI. <br/> <br/> If someone were serious about building strong AI, by the time someone proposes using their software for a Turing Test, it's likely already to be grossly overqualified. For example, I suspect Siri, Google Now, and Cordana could all beat some sort of Turing Test (perhaps after minimal tweaking). But they're far larger than necessary for merely competing in a Turing Test, and that's because they were designed for an entirely different purpose. <br/> <br/> Success at a Turing Test will be an afterthought for any interesting or useful strong AI venture.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?cid=1013#addyourcomment" cid="1013" subject="Re: the forest is trees" cid="1013" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1013" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml#c1013">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?threaded=true#c1013">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">some thoughts</h3><div class="cbody">2. Plenty of other chatbots have similarly claimed to have "passed" the Turing test in the past (often with higher ratings). Here's a story from three years ago about another bot, Cleverbot, "passing" the Turing Test by convincing 59% of judges it was human (much higher than the 33% Eugene Goostman) claims. <br/> <br/> - "passing the test" is not about getting a maximum number of the judges to think that the bot was human. The test is passed if, in repeated tests, one or more (preferrably more) of the human judges CONSISTENTLY identify the bot as a person in nearly 50% of the cases AND the person as a bot in 50% of the cases. Identifying something correctly half the time is equal to a coinflip, meaning the judges are guessing randomly, meaning they cannot tell if they are speaking to a person or AI. <br/> <br/> 3. It "beat" the Turing test here by "gaming" the rules -- by telling people the computer was a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine in order to mentally explain away odd responses.<br/><br/>- constricting the test is not forbidden. In fact, specialized Turing tests are often used in game AI research to test different aspects of AI, say navigation. They use the term believability test. Furthermore, there is no indication that constricting the test somehow favors the computer. In a correctly set up Turing test, half the time the judges would have communicated with a real Ukrainian 13 year old boy. If anything, such test would probably be even harder to pass, since the creators of the bot would have had to assemble a large corpus of text from 13 year old Ukrainian boys (something I doubt). <br/> <br/> 6. The whole concept of the Turing Test itself is kind of a joke. While it's fun to think about, creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence. Many in the AI world look on the Turing Test as a needless distraction.<br/><br/>- the Turing test arose from the problem that there is no good definition of machine intelligence and that problem is still not solved. The test was devised as an operational definition, i.e. machine intelligence was defined through its validation test. The validation criteria was chosen to be intuitive and self-evident - if something is not distinguishable from human intelligence, then it must be as intelligent. The assumption was that a truly intelligence machine intelligence would certainly pass such test.<br/><br/>If we allow that non-intelligent agents can pass the test, then we fall into the pit-falls of philosophy, everything that Turing wanted to avoid. What would it mean for something to appear intelligent but in actuality not be? How do we define REALLY intelligent as opposed to appearing intelligent? How do we know that other humans are intelligent and not just appearing intelligent? <br/> <br/> Searle argues on similar lines that all that computers do is symbol manipulation (the Chinese Room argument) without ever really understanding the content. He claims that there can never be hard AI. His argument sure seems very intuitive. But what does it say about the human brain, are not neurons doing signal processing without really appraising thought content? <br/> <br/> If we reject Searle and allow for emergent intelligence, then on what grounds do we reject the intelligence of a hypothetetical chatbot that passes the test (note I am not talking about this particular bot)? Perhaps we sould define artificial intelligence functionally or behaviorially - mere appearance of intelligence is enough.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?cid=1039#addyourcomment" cid="1039" subject="some thoughts" cid="1039" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1039" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml#c1039">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?threaded=true#c1039">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">hmmm</h3><div class="cbody">It's a good thing to check scientific claims against high standards. It would also be a good thing to hold your own reasoning to standards of the same kind. Sadly, at least three of the six arguments you're putting forward are not arguments at all. Not debating the verdict, but you should really try harder than this, Techdirt.<br/><br/><br/>1. It's not a "supercomputer," it's a chatbot. It's a script made to mimic human conversation. There is no intelligence, artificial or not involved. It's just a chatbot.<br/><br/>- This doesn't seem very convincing. Define 'supercomputer, a virtual computer is not a computer? Also: define 'intelligence'.<br/><br/><br/>2. Plenty of other chatbots have similarly claimed to have "passed" the Turing test in the past (often with higher ratings). Here's a story from three years ago about another bot, Cleverbot, "passing" the Turing Test by convincing 59% of judges it was human (much higher than the 33% Eugene Goostman) claims.<br/><br/>- Others passed with higher scores. How is this an argument? <br/> <br/> <br/> 3. It "beat" the Turing test here by "gaming" the rules -- by telling people the computer was a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine in order to mentally explain away odd responses.<br/>The "rules" of the Turing test always seem to change. Hell, Turing's original test was quite different anyway.<br/><br/>- Are you trying to say that 13 year old Ukrainians are not human beings?<br/><br/><br/>4. The "rules" of the Turing test always seem to change. Hell, Turing's original test was quite different anyway.<br/><br/>+ I suppose this is your first real argument. Too bad you didn't take the time to be a bit more specific.<br/><br/><br/>5. As Chris Dixon points out, you don't get to run a single test with judges that you picked and declare you accomplished something. That's just not how it's done. If someone claimed to have created nuclear fusion or cured cancer, you'd wait for some peer review and repeat tests under other circumstances before buying it, right?<br/><br/>+ Now you're talking. This is a real argument. Why isn't this on the top of the list?<br/><br/><br/>6. The whole concept of the Turing Test itself is kind of a joke. While it's fun to think about, creating a chatbot that can fool humans is not really the same thing as creating artificial intelligence. Many in the AI world look on the Turing Test as a needless distraction.<br/><br/>- And there you go again. It didn't pass the Turing test because the Turing test is stupid? <br/> <br/> <br/> And this is just ugly. It's not true because something else wasn't true either:<br/><br/>"Oh, and the biggest red flag of all.

The particles of sand at the bottom of a real, static pile do not have to 'compute' to determine that they remain stationary, but the computational ones must constantly check that they have not interpenetrated each other or shifted since the last time-slice occurred.

<div class="cbody">Whatever else Eugene has accomplished, it's certainly motivated more than a few people to WD-40 those rusty Rhetoric class and Philosophy 210 skillz and bring them to bear on Mike's common sense explication of this story. These comments have only succeeded in sharing their authors' opinion of their own intelligence and analytical ability. Sadly, this does little to answer the question of whether or not this 'Eugene' device satisfies the conditions of the Turing Test.<br/><br/>More importantly, such respondents do not deal with the question of whether software like Eugene (and predecessors) is not more a "program designed to imitate human conversational function", manipulating symbols and text of which it has no real understanding, than an actual "thinking machine". (This was Searle's objection to the test in his 1980 paper, <i> Minds, Brains, and Programs</i>.) <br/> <br/> When a computer/program can incorporate prior content of a conversation into an original thought or proposition, it will be somewhat convincing, and might actually win the Loebner Prize. (Not to say that's ever a motivation for such research.) Indeed, the 'winner' of the first Loebner competition (Weintraub's <i> PC Therapist</i>) did so by the programmed emulation of pauses and misspellings common to human respondents, not by 'intelligence'. Unless you want to argue that our intelligence is defined by it's limitations and inefficiencies.<br/><br/>I doubt Turing would consider Eugene a "thinking machine", or an example of "artificial intelligence". Now, when a software/hardware construct can misconstrue obvious common sense objections such as Mike has raised here and then respond as if he had instead presented a tightly-reasoned, peer-reviewed thesis...THEN I'll be impressed. Because choosing the response "Let me show off how smart I am." rather than, you know, actually contributing something, really does demonstrate (the misuse of) human intelligence; as well as some other, less commendable human traits.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?cid=1386#addyourcomment" cid="1386" subject="" cid="1386" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1386" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml#c1386">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?threaded=true#c1386">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Recent Turing Test</h3><div class="cbody">I served as a judge in the Turing Test event held in London last weekend. Although the claims may be overblown, there were many things about the test that were quite solid. For example, the judges could ask anything they wanted: it was <br/> truly an unrestricted turing test in which a judge simultaneously carried on text-based conversations with one machine and one human. Problems included that (1) there were too many variables: some non-native judges, some non-native participants; young and old judges and participants from quite varied backgrounds; (2) only 30 trials per chatbot, (3) limited to 5 minutes for simultaneous conversations with one computer and one human (hard to do unless you type quickly, but even if you type quickly it seemed like not enough time---too much pressure to think of what to ask, especially since there were built-in delays in the computer's responses and not all humans responded quickly either); (4) some confusion among judges about the rules of the game. And so on. Furthermore, Turing merely predicted that within 50 years (i.e., by the year 2000) some program would be able to fool 30% of the judges. He did not say that that would signal that the program was intelligent. Nonetheless, it was an interesting demonstration.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?cid=1490#addyourcomment" cid="1490" subject="Re:  Recent Turing Test" cid="1490" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_1490" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml#c1490">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140609/07284327524/no-supercomputer-did-not-pass-turing-test-first-time-everyone-should-know-better.shtml?threaded=true#c1490">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]
