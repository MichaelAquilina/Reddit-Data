<h1 class="posttitle">Stingray Documents Show Law Enforcement Using 'Terrorism' To Obtain Equipment To Fight Regular Crime</h1><h3>from the <i>because-WMDs-but-here's-a-low-level-drug-dealer-we-busted</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
<p>
<a href="https://www.muckrock.com/accounts/profile/scott/" target="_blank">Scott Ainslie</a> at MuckRock has <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/illinois-168/harris-corporation-11372/" target="_blank">pried loose a few more Stingray documents with a FOIA request</a>. What was requested were contractual documents, which seem to be something law enforcement agencies feel more comfortable with releasing. Anything pertaining to the actual use of Stingray devices still remains <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140604/08245927455/us-marshals-step-to-keep-florida-police-departments-stingray-documents-out-hands-aclu.shtml" target="_blank">heavily shrouded</a>, thanks in no small part to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140613/04473627563/administration-helping-bury-documents-related-to-local-law-enforcement-use-cell-tower-spoofers.shtml" target="_blank">the intercession</a> of the federal government.
<br/><br/>
Still, there is some useful information to be gleaned from the responsive documents, not the least of which is the fact that the DHS will happily fund local law enforcement's surveillance technology if they cross themselves and say the word "terrorism" three time during the requisition process.
<br/><br/>
The entire purchase is itemized on the request form under "Homeland Security." Specifics are redacted, not only on the purchase order, but also the letter from the governor's office signing off on the acquisition. But a few details manage to escape the black marker. The letter from the governor's office notes that this is no normal purchase.
<blockquote>
<i>The Illinois State Police has issued a request for a Procurement Code exception in order <b>to covertly purchase [redacted] from Harris Corporation for conducting covert investigations</b>. This exception is requested so that the Illinois State Police may purchase components directly from the vendor and decrease the possibility of sensitive information being disseminated inappropriately.</i></blockquote>
And this bit of sloppy redaction allows part of what must be a very ominous sentence to be revealed:
<br/><br/>
<center><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/S4vObUK.png" style="width: 500px; height: 61px;"/></center>
<br/>
If you can't make it out, the last three words of the redaction are "weapons of mass destruction." The letter also confirms that the purchase is funded by a DHS grant.
<br/><br/>
As is the case when agencies reluctantly provide responsive documents, many of the documents look like they were scanned in by a poorly-trained monkey with an inner ear disorder, while others are apparently scans of tenth-generation copies made by the ancient copier kept around past the point of usefulness <i>solely</i> for responding to FOIA requests. This helps keep much of the text from being searchable, and in some cases early on, even <i>legible</i>.
<br/><br/>
Other points of interest include wording in the Harris contract. As has been pointed out before, Harris ties law enforcement up with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140313/12065026569/newly-obtained-documents-show-law-enforcement-agencies-all-over-california-are-using-stingray-devices.shtml" target="_blank">non-disclosure agreements</a> that (supposedly) prevent them from ever revealing information like this or, indeed, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/wireless/articles/20140303/14234726413/police-tell-courts-non-disclosure-agreement-prevents-them-getting-warrant-cell-phone-tower-spoofers.shtml" target="_blank">seeking warrants</a> before using the equipment. Things may have changed since 2008 (when this requisition was completed), but the wording here doesn't seem to be nearly as extreme as the interpretation provided by law enforcement agencies.
<blockquote>
<i>A. Publicity. Neither party will, without the prior written consent of the other party: (a) make any news release, public announcement, denial or confirmation of this Agreement or its subject matter, or (b) in any manner advertise or publish the fact of their Agreement.</i></blockquote>
This contractual language seems rather minimal as compared to what has surfaced more recently.
<blockquote>
<i>"The Harris (REDACTED) equipment is proprietary and used for surveillance missions," the agreement reads. "Its capabilities can only be discussed with sworn law enforcement officers, the military or federal government. This equipment's capabilities are not for public knowledge and are protected under non-disclosure agreements as well as Title 18 USC 2512."</i></blockquote>
Apparently, Harris felt added restrictions were necessary to keep the public from learning about the technology public servants were deploying against them.
<br/><br/>
This Stingray was obtained in the fall of 2008, and it appears to be the only one the Illinois State Police own. But there are documents from 2006 and 2007 showing warranty replacements and repairs to existing Harris equipment, but most likely not a cell tower spoofer.
<br/><br/>
Then there's this remarkable paragraph that's included <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/illinois-168/harris-corporation-11372/#1198538-14-0745-response" target="_blank">in the letter justifying redactions</a>, which is a masterwork of unchecked fear:
<blockquote>
<i>Release of the information requested would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel. Police officers, as well as the valuable and dedicated support personnel who work with them, face unknown and unpredictable dangers every day. Recent and unpredictable attacks on police officers and other criminal justice employees and their families point to an alarming trend in violence targeted directly at those persons simply because they represent law and order. Examples of violence toward law enforcement, criminal justice personnel and their families include: the shootout with a suspect in California armed with an AK47 on September 11, 2011; The murder of Maywood Police Officer Tom Wood as he had finished his shift in October 2006; Violence has not only been directed toward police officers. Damon Daniels was killed November 13, 2004 during a home-invasion robbery at the home he shared with his mother, Gery Gilbert, a secretary for the Oakland, California Police Department. In Texas, Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland, his wife Cynthia, and Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse were murdered by former Justice of the Peace Eric Williams in purported retaliation for prosecution of Williams for theft, which resulted in Williams losing his position as Justice of the Peace. Additionally, in April 2013, two members of a white supremacist prison gang were arrested for the murder of Colorado Department of Corrections head Tom Clements. Finally, consider the murder of the husband and mother of Judge Joan Lefkow. The suspect in that case, Bart Ross, was upset with Judge Lefkow because of an adverse ruling in a medical malpractice case. These are just a few incidents of violence directed at police officers, criminal justice system employees and their families.</i></blockquote>
There's no real trend here. Law enforcement <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131230/15411225716/number-officers-killed-line-duty-drops-to-50-year-low-while-number-citizens-killed-cops-remains-unchanged.shtml" target="_blank">is safer</a> than it's been in 50 years. The only thing "alarming" is that the state police are using a highly-subjective fear to make supposedly "objective" redactions -- ones that weigh the public interest rather than just a handful of unrelated events scattered over a decade.
<br/><br/>
The most notable aspect of the documents is what it confirms: that law enforcement agencies are leveraging terrorism fears to acquire pervasive surveillance technology (that was initially developed for use in <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140610/11461127539/law-enforcement-agencies-continue-to-obtain-military-equipment-claiming-united-states-is-war-zone.shtml" target="_blank">war zones</a>) -- and that the DHS is more than happy to oblige them by funding the purchases. This intertwining of law enforcement and national security explains the federal government's intercession in Freedom of Information denials.

<h3 class="commentsubject">No need for terrorists?</h3><div class="cbody">Nonsense. There is a large and increasing need for terrorists who want to destroy the American way of life and its freedoms. They are trained under the working title of "law officer", are getting equipped with military-grade weapons and transports, terrorize the citizenship, making arbitrary raids, beat people up, shoot their dogs, leave a trail of havoc and fear in their wake and stop people from insisting on their rights.<br/><br/>They use "plea bargains" to make people give up on their right to due process. They torture and kill people and rain death from the skies in various countries. They maintain rape camps called "prison" and incarcerate unprecedented numbers of citizens for terms that have no relation to the made-up crimes they are supposed to be connected with.<br/><br/>There has never been a better job market for terrorists in the U.S.A.<br/><br/>What the U.S. tries to curb is unlicensed terrorism.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?cid=50#addyourcomment" cid="50" subject="No need for terrorists?" cid="50" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_50" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml#c50">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?threaded=true#c50">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<div class="cbody"><i> violence targeted directly at those persons simply because they represent law and order</i><br/><br/>So they have redacted these documents because there is violence against police officers, criminal justice system employees and their families simply because they represent law and order. So how does redacting the documents help? <br/> <br/> Oh, wait, I think I get it, by childishly withholding information sought in a FOIA request and preventing the public from seeing what they are doing, they are not representing law and order - thus making them less of a target for the people that want to act against those types of people.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Re: Probably best not to compare the numbers...</h3><div class="cbody"><b> Cops are the ones fighting the cameras.</b><br/><br/>Of course they are. Would you like to have every word, every action, every step, and every motion you make held up for review at all times? Remember, this isn't "forgot to use the TPS form" so your boss calls you out stuff, but things that happen in moments of great tension, adrenaline fueled persuits, breaking up fights... the list goes on and on. Perhaps they say something that is a little out of line (like cussing). Do you really want EVERYTHING that EVERY officer does up for review every time? The stress of having that unwavering eye on everything you do is enough to cause officers to back away and do nothing rather than risk action. That doesn't help the public.<br/><br/><b>One would think that if there are just soooooo many false claims of police brutality, the cops would be falling over themselves to provide more evidence against these people.</b><br/><br/>Since every situation is two sided, the presence of cameras certainly does change the approach - but it changes it for both sides. Since the police generally aren't busting heads of people just standing around or complying with an arrest, clearly something has happened. It cannot be only that the police are suddenly so much better behaved, but rather than the aggressive citizens are also taking a step back, knowing they can't yell about police brutality at every turn.<br/><br/><a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/california-police-body-cameras-cuts-violence-complaints-rialto' rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/california-police-body-cameras-cuts-violence-compl aints-rialto</a><br/><br/>Key numbers here, police use of force fell 60% - and complaints by the public dropped a whopping 88%. Both sides do behave better, and moreover:<br/><br/><i>Most now accepted cameras as another part of the job, said Sgt Josh Lindsay. A self-confessed technophile, he said they provided context to contentious incidents partially captured by bystanders' phones. "Now you can see the [suspect] punching the officer twice in the face before he hits him with his baton."</i><br/><br/>Yes, the whole Rodney King thing would have played differently, wouldn't it?<br/><br/>The officers will come around. The risk is increase in costs for policing, as officers are more likely to call backup and less likely to handle situations alone.

Nice guys those Peoria police officers are.<br/><br/>I would also question if she was really "unable to sign" the ticket or simply unwilling - considering she was apparently able to tell the officer "I'm not giving blood or blowin on nothin!".<br/><br/>I assume these were included in response to the FOIA request because the incident happened at the Glen-War Memorial and they needed something with "War" in the document to justify getting a Stingray device.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?cid=258#addyourcomment" cid="258" subject="DUI" cid="258" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_258" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml#c258">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?threaded=true#c258">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re:</h3><div class="cbody">There's an argument to be made. I don't endorse this as the correct reading of the statute, but it's an argument at least:<br/><br/>�1(c) makes punishable the publishing or electronic dissemination of "any advertisement" of a device. �3 says it's not unlawful "to advertise for sale" a device "if the advertisement is mailed, sent, or carried [etc.]" to one of an enumerated group of people. The phrase "the advertisement" in �3 clearly refers to an "advertise[ment] for sale," as found earlier in that section. However, in �1, the language is "any advertisement." This leads us to the possibility that �1 envisions "an[] advertisement" that is not an advertisement "for sale" of a device. Nor is it a strained reading of English to claim that an advertisement doesn't necessarily have to publicize something for sale. Just glance at the entry for "advertisement" in the OED, and you'll find numerous instances of the word being used to denote the general notification of someone or some people about something, without any necessary mercantile implication. It's true that we use "advertisement" now generally to denote something intended to convey an offer to sell something, but given the ambiguity in how sections 1 and 3 of the statute seem to be using advertisement ("any advertisement" versus an advertisement specifically "for sale"), we can perhaps conclude that the statute is indeed meant to prohibit the general disclosure of such devices' capabilities, as well as targeting specifically advertisements for sale.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?cid=407#addyourcomment" cid="407" subject="Re:" cid="407" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_407" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml#c407">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?threaded=true#c407">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

This was by no means a case of police brutality, but a camera told a different story, and the rest is history.<br/><br/>53 people died in the ensuing riots, with thousands severely injured and around $1 billion in property damage, and every last bit of it is on the heads of the idiotic news hounds who chose to put sensationalism and ratings above common sense, journalistic ethics, or basic honesty.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?cid=470#addyourcomment" cid="470" subject="Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Probably best not to compare the numbers..." cid="470" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_470" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml#c470">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140619/09211027625/stingray-documents-show-law-enforcement-using-terrorism-to-obtain-equipment-to-fight-regular-crime.shtml?threaded=true#c470">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]
