<h2>Introduction</h2>
   <blockquote><i>
      <p>
      Never ascribe to malice, that which can be explained by incompetence.<br>
   </i>- Napoleon</blockquote>
   <p>
   
  <p>
   In the interests of creating employment opportunities in the Java programming
   field, I am passing on these tips from the masters on how to write code that is
   so difficult to maintain, that the people who come after you will take years to
   make even the simplest changes. Further, if you follow all these rules
   religiously, you will even guarantee <b>yourself</b> a lifetime of employment,
   since no one but you has a hope in hell of maintaining the code. Then again, if
   you followed <b>all</b> these rules religiously, even you wouldn't be able to
   maintain the code!

   <p>You don't want to overdo this.  Your code should not <b>look</b> hopelessly
   unmaintainable, just <b>be</b> that way.  Otherwise it stands the risk of being
   rewritten or <!--<a href="jglossr.html#REFACTORING">-->refactored<!--/a-->.

   <h2>General Principles</h2>
   <blockquote><i>
      <p>
      Quidquid latine dictum sit, altum sonatur.
      <br>
   </i>- Whatever is said in Latin sounds profound.</blockquote>
   To foil the maintenance programmer, you have to understand how he thinks.  He
   has your giant program.  He has no time to read it all, much less understand it.
   He wants to rapidly find the place to make his change, make it and get out and
   have no unexpected side effects from the change.

   <p>

   He views your code through a toilet paper tube.  He can only see a tiny piece of
   your program at a time.  You want to make sure he can never get at the big
   picture from doing that. You want to make it as hard as possible for him to find
   the code he is looking for.  But even more important, you want to make it as
   awkward as possible for him to safely <b>ignore</b> anything.

   <p>

   Programmers are lulled into complacency by conventions.  By every once in a
   while, by subtly violating convention, you force him to read every line of your
   code with a magnifying glass.

   <p>

   You might get the idea that every language feature makes code unmaintainable --
   not so, only if properly misused.

   <h2>Naming</h2>

   <blockquote><i>

      <p>

      &quot;When I use a word,&quot; Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, &quot;it
      means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.&quot;
   </i><br>- Lewis Carroll -- Through the Looking Glass, Chapter 6</blockquote>

   Much of the skill in writing unmaintainable code is the art of naming variables
   and methods. They don't matter at all to the compiler.  That gives you huge
   latitude to use them to befuddle the maintenance programmer.
   <ol>
        <h4>New Uses For <cite>Names For Baby</cite></h4>
         Buy a copy of a baby naming book and you'll never be at a loss for variable
         names. Fred is a wonderful name, and easy to type.  If you're looking for easy-to-type
         variable names, try <span class="code">adsf</span> or <span class="code">aoeu</span>
         if you type with a <!--a href="dsk.html"-->DSK keyboard<!--/a-->.
  <p>
          <h4>Single Letter Variable Names</h4>
If you call your variables a, b, c, then it will be impossible to search for
         instances of them using a simple text editor. Further, nobody will be able to
         guess what they are for. If anyone even hints at breaking the tradition honoured
         since F&Oslash;RTRAN of using i, j, and k for indexing variables, namely
         replacing them with ii, jj and kk, warn them about what the Spanish Inquisition
         did to heretics.
  <p>
          <h4>Creative Miss-spelling</h4>

         If you must use descriptive variable and function names, misspell them. By
         misspelling in some function and variable names, and spelling it correctly in
         others (such as SetPintleOpening SetPintalClosing) we effectively negate the use
         of grep or IDE search techniques.  It works amazingly well.  Add an
         international flavor by spelling <i>tory</i> or <i>tori</i> in different
         theatres/theaters.
  <p>
          <h4>Be Abstract</h4>

         In naming functions and variables, make heavy use of abstract words like <i>it</i>,
         <i>everything</i>, <i>data</i>, <i>handle</i>, <i>stuff</i>, <i>do</i>, <i>routine</i>,
         <i>perform</i> and the digits e.g. <span class="code">routineX48</span>, <span class="code">PerformDataFunction</span>,
         <span class="code">DoIt</span>, <span class="code">HandleStuff</span> and <span class="code">do_args_method</span>.
  <p>
          <h4>A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.S.</h4>

         Use acronyms to keep the code terse. Real men never define acronyms; they
         understand them genetically.
  <p>
          <h4>Thesaurus Surrogatisation</h4>

         To break the boredom, use a thesaurus to look up as much alternate vocabulary
         as possible to refer to the same action, e.g. <i>display</i>, <i>show</i>, <i>present</i>.
         Vaguely hint there is some subtle difference, where none exists. However, if
         there are two similar functions that have a crucial difference, always use the
         same word in describing both functions (e.g. <i>print</i> to mean &quot;write to
         a file&quot;,  &quot;put ink on paper&quot; and &quot;display on the screen&quot;).
         Under no circumstances, succumb to demands to write a glossary with the special
         purpose project vocabulary unambiguously defined. Doing so would be an
         unprofessional breach of the structured design principle of <i>information
         hiding</i>.
  <p>
          <h4>Use Plural Forms From Other Languages</h4>

         A VMS script kept track of the &quot;statii&quot; returned from various &quot;Vaxen&quot;.
         <!--a href="esperanto.html"-->Esperanto<!--/a-->
         , <a href="http://www.kli.org/"  target="_blank">Klingon</a> and <a href="http://www.chriswetherell.com/hobbit/default.asp target="_blank"">Hobbitese</a>
         qualify as languages for these purposes. For pseudo-Esperanto pluraloj, add oj.
         You will be doing your part toward world peace.
  <p>
          <h4>CapiTaliSaTion</h4>

         Randomly capitalize the first letter of a syllable in the middle of a word. For
         example <span class="code">ComputeRasterHistoGram()</span>.
  <p>
          <h4>Reuse Names</h4>

         Wherever the rules of the language permit, give classes, constructors, methods,
         member variables, parameters and local variables the same names. For extra
         points, reuse local variable names inside {} blocks. The goal is to force the
         maintenance programmer to carefully examine the <!--a href="jglosss.html#SCOPE"-->scope<!--/a-->
         of every instance. In particular, in Java, make ordinary methods masquerade as
         constructors.
  <p>
          <h4>&Aring;ccented Letters</h4>

         Use accented characters on variable names.  E.g.

         <ul class="code">
            typedef struct { int i; } &iacute;nt;

         </ul>

         where the second &iacute;nt's &iacute; is actually i-acute.   With only a simple
         text editor, it's nearly impossible to distinguish the slant of the accent mark.
  <p>
          <h4>Exploit Compiler Name Length Limits</h4>

         If the compiler will only distinguish the first, say, 8 characters of names,
         then vary the endings e.g. <i>var_unit_update()</i> in one case and <i>var_unit_setup()</i>
         in another. The compiler will treat both as <i>var_unit</i>.
  <p>
         <h4>Underscore, a Friend Indeed</h4>

         Use _ and __ as identifiers.
  <p>
          <h4>Mix Languages</h4>

         Randomly intersperse two languages (human or computer). If your boss insists
         you use his language, tell him you can organise your thoughts better in your own
         language, or, if that does not work, allege linguistic discrimination and
         threaten to sue your employers for a vast sum.
  <p>
          <h4>Extended ASCII</h4>

         Extended ASCII characters are perfectly valid as variable names, including &szlig;,
         &ETH;, and &ntilde; characters. They are almost impossible to type without
         copying/pasting in a simple text editor.
  <p>
          <h4>Names From Other Languages</h4>

         Use foreign language dictionaries as a source for variable names. For example,
         use the German  <i>punkt</i> for <i>point</i>.  Maintenance coders, without your
         firm grasp of German, will enjoy the multicultural experience of deciphering the
         meaning.
  <p>
          <h4>Names From Mathematics</h4>

         Choose variable names that masquerade as mathematical operators, e.g.:

         <ul class="code">
            openParen <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> (slash <font color="#000099">
            <b>+</b></font> asterix) <font color="#000099"><b>/</b></font>
            equals;

         </ul>
  <p>
          <h4>Bedazzling Names</h4>

         Choose variable names with irrelevant emotional connotation. e.g.:

         <ul class="code">
            marypoppins <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> (superman
            <font color="#000099"><b>+</b></font> starship) <font color="#000099">
            <b>/</b></font> god;

         </ul>

         This confuses the reader because they have difficulty disassociating the
         emotional connotations of the words from the logic they're trying to think about.
  <p>
          <h4>Rename and Reuse</h4>

         This trick works especially well in Ada, a language immune to many of the
         standard obfuscation techniques. The people who originally named all the objects
         and packages you use were morons. Rather than try to convince them to change,
         just use renames and subtypes to rename everything to names of your own devising.
         Make sure to leave a few references to the old names in, as a trap for the
         unwary.
  <p>
          <h4>When To Use i</h4>

         Never use <span class="code">i</span> for the innermost loop variable. Use
         anything but. Use <span class="code">i</span> liberally for any other purpose
         especially for non-int variables. Similarly use <span class="code">n</span> as a
         loop index.
  <p>         <h4>Conventions Schmentions</h4>

         Ignore the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/"  target="_blank">Sun Java Coding
         Conventions</a>, after all, <!--a href="gotchas.html#INCONSISTENCIES"-->Sun does<!--/a-->.
         Fortunately,  the compiler won't tattle when you violate them.

         The goal is to come up with names that differ subtlely only in case. If you are
         forced to use the capitalisation conventions, you can still subvert wherever the
         choice is ambigous, e.g. use <b>both</b>

         <i>input<b>F</b>ile<b>n</b>ame</i> and

         <i>input<b>f</b>ile<b>N</b>ame</i>.

         Invent your own hopelessly complex naming conventions, then berate everyone else
         for not following them.
  <p>         <h4>Lower Case l Looks a Lot Like the Digit 1</h4>

         Use lower case l to indicate long constants. e.g. 10l is more likely to be
         mistaken for 101 that 10L is. Ban any fonts that <!--a href="projects.html#PROOFREADERFONT"-->clearly
         disambiguate<!--/a--> uvw wW gq9 2z 5s il17|!j oO08  `'&quot; ;,.  m nn rn {[()]}.
         Be creative.
  <p>         <h4>Reuse of Global Names as Private</h4>

         Declare a global array in module A, and a private one of the same name in the
         header file for module B, so that it appears that it's the global array you are
         using in module B, but it isn't. Make no reference in the comments to this
         duplication.
  <p>         <h4>Recycling Revisited</h4>

         Use scoping as confusingly as possible by recycling variable names in
         contradictory ways. For example, suppose you have global variables A and B, and
         functions foo and bar. If you know that variable A will be regularly passed to
         foo and B to bar, make sure to define the functions as function foo(B) and
         function bar(A) so that inside the functions A will always be referred to as B
         and vice versa. With more functions and globals, you can create vast confusing
         webs of mutually contradictory uses of the same names.
  <p>         <h4>Recycle Your Variables</h4>

         Wherever scope rules permit, reuse existing unrelated variable names.
         Similarly, use the same temporary variable for two unrelated purposes (purporting
         to save stack slots). For a fiendish variant, morph the variable, for example,
         assign a value to a variable at the top of a very long method, and then
         somewhere in the middle, change the meaning of the variable in a subtle way,
         such as converting it from a 0-based coordinate to a 1-based coordinate. Be
         certain not to document this change in meaning.
  <p>         <h4>Cd wrttn wtht vwls s mch trsr</h4>

         When using abbreviations inside variable or method names, break the boredom
         with several variants for the same word, and even spell it out longhand once in
         while. This helps defeat those lazy bums who use text search to understand only
         some aspect of your program. Consider variant spellings as a variant on the ploy,
         e.g. mixing International <i>colour</i>, with American <i>color</i> and dude-speak
         <i>kulerz</i>. If you spell out names in full, there is only one possible way to
         spell each name. These are too easy for the maintenance programmer to remember.
         Because there are so many different ways to abbreviate a word, with
         abbreviations, you can have several different variables that all have the same
         apparent purpose. As an added bonus, the maintenance programmer might not even
         notice they are separate variables.
  <p>         <h4>Misleading names</h4>

         Make sure that every method does a little bit more (or less) than its name
         suggests. As a simple example, a method named <span class="code">isValid(x)</span>
         should as a side effect convert x to binary and store the result in a database.
  <p>         <h4>m_</h4>

         a naming convention from the world of C++ is the use of &quot;m_&quot; in
         front of members.  This is supposed to help you tell them apart from methods, so
         long as you forget that &quot;method&quot; also starts with the letter &quot;m&quot;.
  <p>         <h4>o_apple obj_apple</h4>

         Use an &quot;o&quot; or &quot;obj&quot; prefix for each instance of the class
         to show that you're thinking of the big, polymorphic picture.
  <p>         <h4>Hungarian Notation</h4>

         Hungarian Notation is the tactical nuclear weapon of source code obfuscation
         techniques; use it! Due to the sheer volume of source code contaminated by this
         idiom nothing can kill a maintenance engineer faster than a well planned
         Hungarian Notation attack. The following tips will help you corrupt the original
         intent of Hungarian Notation:
<p>
         <ul>
               Insist on using &quot;c&quot; for const in C++ and other languages that directly
               enforce the const-ness of a variable.
  <p>               Seek out and use Hungarian warts that have meaning in languages other than your
               current language. For example insist on the PowerBuilder &quot;l_&quot; and &quot;a_
               &quot; {local and argument} scoping prefixes and always use the VB-esque style
               of having a Hungarian wart for every control type when coding to C++. Try to
               stay ignorant of the fact that megs of plainly visible MFC source code does not
               use Hungarian warts for control types.
  <p>               Always violate the Hungarian principle that the most commonly used variables
               should carry the least extra information around with them. Achieve this end
               through the techniques outlined above and by insisting that each class type have
               a custom wart prefix. Never allow anyone to remind you that <b>no</b> wart tells
               you that something <b>is</b> a class. The importance of this rule cannot be
               overstated if you fail to adhere to its principles the source code may become
               flooded with shorter variable names that have a higher vowel/consonant ratio. In
               the worst case scenario this can lead to a full collapse of obfuscation and the
               spontaneous reappearance of English Notation in code!
  <p>               Flagrantly violate the Hungarian-esque concept that function parameters and
               other high visibility symbols must be given meaningful names, but that Hungarian
               type warts all by themselves make excellent temporary variable names.
  <p>               Insist on carrying outright orthogonal information in your Hungarian warts.
               Consider this real world example &quot;a_crszkvc30LastNameCol&quot;. It took a
               team of maintenance engineers nearly 3 days to figure out that this whopper
               variable name described a const, reference, function argument that was holding
               information from a database column of type Varchar[30] named &quot;LastName&quot;
               which was part of the table's primary key. When properly combined with the
               principle that &quot;all variables should be public&quot; this technique has the
               power to render thousands of lines of source code obsolete instantly!
  <p>               Use to your advantage the principle that the human brain can only hold 7 pieces
               of information concurrently. For example code written to the above standard has
               the following properties:

               <ul>

                  <li>
                     a single assignment statement carries 14 pieces of type and name information.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     a single function call that passes three parameters and assigns a result carries
                     29 pieces of type and name information.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     Seek to improve this excellent, but far too concise, standard. Impress
                     management and coworkers by recommending a 5 letter day of the week prefix to
                     help isolate code written on 'Monam' and 'FriPM'.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                     It is easy to overwhelm the short term memory with even a moderately complex
                     nesting structure, <b>especially</b> when the maintenance programmer can't see
                     the start and end of each block on screen simultaneously.
                  </li>

               </ul>

         </ul>
  <p>         <h4>Hungarian Notation Revisited</h4>

         One followon trick in the Hungarian notation is &quot;change the type of a
         variable but leave the variable name unchanged&quot;. This is almost invariably
         done in windows apps with the migration from Win16 :- WndProc(HWND hW, WORD wMsg,
         WORD wParam, LONG lParam) to Win32 WndProc(HWND hW, UINT wMsg, WPARAM wParam,
         LPARAM lParam) where the w values hint that they are words, but they really
         refer to longs. The real value of this approach comes clear with the Win64
         migration, when the parameters will be 64 bits wide, but the old &quot;w&quot;
         and &quot;l&quot; prefixes will remain forever.
  <p>         <h4>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </h4>

         If you have to define a structure to hold data for callbacks, always call the
         structure PRIVDATA.  Every module can define it's own PRIVDATA.  In VC++, this
         has the advantage of confusing the debugger so that if you have a PRIVDATA
         variable and try to expand it in the watch window, it doesn't know which
         PRIVDATA you mean, so it just picks one.
  <p>         <h4>Obscure film references </h4>

         Use constant names like <span class="code">LancelotsFavouriteColour</span>
         instead of <span class="code">blue</span> and assign it hex value of $0204FB.  The
         color looks identical to pure blue on the screen, and a maintenance programmer
         would have to work out 0204FB (or use some graphic tool) to know what it looks
         like. Only someone intimately familiar with Monty Python and the Holy Grail
         would know that Lancelot's favorite color was blue.  If a maintenance programmer
         can't quote entire Monty Python movies from memory, he or she has <b>no</b>
         business being a programmer.

   </i>- Roedy Green</blockquote>
   Much of the skill in writing unmaintainable code is the art of camouflage,
   hiding things, or making things appear to be what they are not. Many depend on
   the fact the compiler is more capable at making fine distinctions than either
   the human eye or the text editor. Here are some of the best camouflaging
   techniques.

         <h4>Code That Masquerades As Comments and Vice Versa</h4>

         Include sections of code that is commented out but at first glance does not
         appear to be.

         <ul class="code">

         Without the colour coding would you notice that three lines of code are
         commented out?
   <p>
         <h4>namespaces</h4>

          Struct/union and typedef struct/union are different name spaces in C (not in
         C++). Use the same name in both name spaces for structures or unions. Make them,
         if possible, nearly compatible.

         <ul class="code">
            typedef struct {

            <br>

            char*    pTr;

            <br>

            size_t   lEn;

            <br>

            } snafu;

            <p>

            struct snafu {

            <br>

            unsigned cNt

            <br>

            char*    pTr;

            <br>

            size_t   lEn;

            <br>

            } A;

            <br>

         </ul>
   <p>
         <h4>Hide Macro Definitions</h4>

         Hide macro definitions in amongst rubbish comments. The programmer will get
         bored and not finish reading the comments thus never discover the macro. Ensure
         that the macro replaces what looks like a perfectly legitimate assignment with
         some bizarre operation, a simple example:

         <ul class="code">
            #define a=b a=0-b

         </ul>
   <p>
         <h4>Look Busy</h4>

         use define statements to make made up functions that simply comment out their
         arguments, e.g.:

         <ul class="code">
            #define fastcopy(x,y,z) <span class="comment">/*xyz*/</span>

            <br>

            ...

            <br>

            fastcopy(array1, array2, size); /* does nothing */

         </ul>
   <p>
         <h4>Use Continuation to hide variables</h4>

         Instead of using

         <ul class="code">
            #define local_var xy_z

         </ul>

         break up &quot;xy_z&quot; onto two lines:

         <ul class="code">
            #define local_var xy\

            <br>

            _z // local_var OK

         </ul>

         That way a global search for xy_z will come up with nothing for that file. To
         the C preprocessor, the &quot;\&quot; at the end of the line means glue this
         line to the next one.
   <p>
         <h4>Arbitrary Names That Masquerade as Keywords</h4>

         When documenting, and you need an arbitrary name to represent a filename use <i>&quot;file
         &quot;</i>. Never use an obviously arbitrary name like <i>&quot;Charlie.dat&quot;</i>
         or <i>&quot;Frodo.txt&quot;</i>. In general, in your examples, use arbitrary
         names that sound as much like reserved keywords as possible. For example, good
         names for parameters or variables would be<i>&quot;bank&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;blank&quot;</i>,
         <i>&quot;class&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;const &quot;</i>, <i>&quot;constant&quot;</i>,
         <i>&quot;input&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;key&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;keyword&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;kind&quot;</i>,
         <i>&quot;output&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;parameter&quot;</i> <i>&quot;parm&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;system&quot;</i>,
         <i>&quot;type&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;value&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;var&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;variable
         &quot;</i>. If you use actual reserved words for your arbitrary names, which
         would be rejected by your command processor or compiler, so much the better. If
         you do this well, the users will be hopelessly confused between reserved
         keywords and arbitrary names in your example, but you can look innocent,
         claiming you did it to help them associate the appropriate purpose with each
         variable.
   <p>
         <h4>Code Names Must Not Match Screen Names</h4>

         Choose your variable names to have absolutely no relation to the labels used
         when such variables are displayed on the screen. E.g. on the screen label the
         field <i>&quot;Postal Code&quot;</i> but in the code call the associated
         variable <i>&quot;zip&quot;</i>.
   <p>
         <h4>Don't Change Names</h4>

         Instead of globally renaming to bring two sections of code into sync, use
         multiple TYPEDEFs of the same symbol.
   <p>
         <h4>How to Hide Forbidden Globals</h4>

         Since global variables are &quot;evil&quot;, define a structure to hold all
         the things you'd put in globals.  Call it something clever like
         EverythingYoullEverNeed.  Make all functions take a pointer to this structure (call
         it handle to confuse things more). This gives the impression that you're not
         using global variables, you're accessing everything through a &quot;handle&quot;.
         Then declare one statically so that all the code is using the same copy anyway.
   <p>
         <h4>Hide Instances With Synonyms</h4>

         Maintenance programmers, in order to see if they'll be any cascading effects
         to a change they make, do a global search for the variables named. This can be
         defeated by this simple expedient of having synonyms, such as

         <ul class="code">
            #define xxx global_var   // in file std.h

            <br>

            #define xy_z  xxx        // in file ..\other\substd.h

            <br>

            #define local_var xy_z   // in file ..\codestd\inst.h

         </ul>

         These defs should be scattered through different include-files. They are
         especially effective if the include-files are located in different directories.
         The other technique is to reuse a name in every scope.  The compiler can tell
         them apart, but a simple minded text searcher cannot. Unfortunately <!--a href="scid.html"-->SCIDs<!--/a-->
         in the coming decade will make this simple technique impossible. since the
         editor understands the scope rules just as well as the compiler.
   <p>
         <h4>Long Similar Variable Names</h4>

         Use very long variable names or class names that differ from each other by
         only one character, or only in upper/lower case. An ideal variable name pair is <i>swimmer</i>
         and <span class="code">swimner</span>. Exploit the failure of most fonts to
         clearly discriminate between <span class="code">ilI1|</span> or <span class="code">oO08</span>
         with identifier pairs like <span class="code">parselnt</span> and <span class="code">parseInt</span>
         or <span class="code">D0Calc</span> and <span class="code">DOCalc</span>. <span class="code">l</span>
         is an exceptionally fine choice for a variable name since it will, to the casual
         glance, masquerade as the constant 1. In many fonts rn looks like an m.  So how
         about a variable swirnrner.

         Create variable names that differ from each other only in case e.g. HashTable
         and Hashtable.
   <p>
         <h4>Similar-Sounding Similar-Looking Variable Names</h4>

         Although we have one variable named xy_z, there's certainly no reason not to
         have many other variables with similar names, such as xy_Z, xy__z, _xy_z, _xyz,
         XY_Z, xY_z, and Xy_z.

         <p>

         Variables that resemble others except for capitalization and underlines have the
         advantage of confounding those who like remembering names by sound or letter-spelling,
         rather than by exact representations.
   <p>
         <h4>Overload and Bewilder</h4>

         In C++, overload library functions by using #define. That way it looks like
         you are using a familiar library function where in actuality you are using
         something totally different.
   <p>
         <h4>Choosing The Best Overload Operator</h4>

         In C++, overload +,-,*,/ to do things totally unrelated to addition,
         subtraction etc. After all, if the Stroustroup can use the shift operator to do
         I/O, why should you not be equally creative? If you overload +, make sure you do
         it in a way that <span class="code">i = i + 5;</span> has a totally different
         meaning from <span class="code">i += 5;</span> Here is an example of elevating
         overloading operator obfuscation to a high art. Overload the '!' operator for a
         class, but have the overload have nothing to do with inverting or negating. Make
         it return an integer. Then, in order to get a logical value for it, you must use '!
         !'. However, this inverts the logic, so [drum roll] you must use '! ! !'.  Don't
         confuse  the ! operator, which returns a boolean 0 or 1, with the ~ bitwise
         logical negation operator.
   <p>
         <h4>Overload new</h4>

         Overload the &quot;new&quot; operator - much more dangerous than overloading
         the +-/*. This can cause total havoc if overloaded to do something different
         from it's original function (but vital to the object's function so it's very
         difficult to change). This should ensure users trying to create a dynamic
         instance get really stumped. You can combine this with the case sensitivity
         trickalso have a member function, and variable called  &quot;New&quot;.
   <p>
         <h4>#define</h4>

         #define in C++ deserves an entire essay on its own to explore its rich
         possibilities for obfuscation. Use lower case #define variables so they
         masquerade as ordinary variables. Never use parameters to your preprocessor
         functions. Do everything with global #defines. One of the most imaginative uses
         of the preprocessor I have heard of was requiring five passes through CPP before
         the code was ready to compile. Through clever use of defines and ifdefs, a
         master of obfuscation can make header files declare different things depending
         on how many times they are included.  This becomes especially interesting when
         one header is included in another header. Here is a particularly devious example:

         <ul class="code">
            #ifndef DONE

            <br>

            <br>

            #ifdef TWICE

            <br>

            <br>

            // put stuff here to declare 3rd time around

            <br>

            void g(char* str);

            <br>

            #define DONE

            <br>

            <br>

            #else // TWICE

            <br>

            #ifdef ONCE

            <br>

            <br>

            // put stuff here to declare 2nd time around

            <br>

            void g(void* str);

            <br>

            #define TWICE

            <br>

            <br>

            #else // ONCE

            <br>

            <br>

            // put stuff here to declare 1st time around

            <br>

            void g(std::string str);

            <br>

            #define ONCE

            <br>

            <br>

            #endif // ONCE

            <br>

            #endif // TWICE

            <br>

            #endif // DONE

         </ul>

         This one gets fun when passing g() a char*, because a different version of g()
         will be called depending on how many times the header was included.
   <p>
         <h4>Compiler Directives</h4>

          Compiler directives were designed with the express purpose of making the same
         code behave completely differently.  Turn the boolean short-circuiting directive
         on and off repeatedly and vigourously, as well as the long strings directive.
   </ol>

   <h2>Documentation</h2>

   <blockquote><i>

      Any fool can tell the truth, but it requires a man of some sense to know how to
      lie well.<br>
   </i>- Samuel Butler (1835 - 1902)</blockquote>
   <p>

   <blockquote><i>
      Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation.<br>
   </i>- Bertrand Meyer</blockquote>
   Since the computer ignores comments and documentation, you can lie outrageously
   and do everything in your power to befuddle the poor maintenance programmer.
   <ol>

         <h4>Lie in the comments</h4>

         You don't have to actively lie, just fail to keep comments as up to date with
         the code.
<p>
         <h4>Document the obvious</h4>

         Pepper the code with comments like <span class="comment">/* add 1 to i */</span>
         however, never document wooly stuff like the overall purpose of the package or
         method.
<p>
         <h4>Document How Not Why</h4>

         Document only the details of what a program does, not what it is attempting to
         accomplish.  That way, if there is a bug, the fixer will have no clue what the
         code should be doing.
<p>
         <h4>Avoid Documenting the &quot;Obvious&quot;</h4>

         If, for example, you were writing an airline reservation system, make sure
         there are at least 25 places in the code that need to be modified if you were to
         add another airline. Never document where they are. People who come after you
         have no business modifying your code without thoroughly understanding every line
         of it.
<p>
         <h4>On the Proper Use Of Documentation Templates</h4>

         Consider function documentation prototypes used to allow automated
         documentation of the code. These prototypes should be copied from one function (or
         method or class) to another, but never fill in the fields. If for some reason
         you are forced to fill in the fields make sure that all parameters are named the
         same for all functions, and all cautions are the same but of course not related
         to the current function at all.
<p>
         <h4>On the Proper Use of Design Documents</h4>

         When implementing a very complicated algorithm, use the classic software
         engineering principles of doing a sound design before beginning coding. Write an
         extremely detailed design document that describes each step in a very
         complicated algorithm.  The more detailed this document is, the better.

         <p>

         In fact, the design doc should break the algorithm down into a hierarchy of
         structured steps, described in a hierarchy of auto-numbered individual
         paragraphs in the document. Use headings at least 5 deep.  Make sure that when
         you are done, you have broken the structure down so completely that there are
         over 500 such auto-numbered paragraphs.  For example, one paragraph might be(this
         is a real example)

         <p>

         1.2.4.6.3.13 - Display all impacts for activity where selected mitigations can
         apply (short pseudocode omitted).

         <p>

         <b>then</b>... (and this is the kicker) when you write the code, for each of
         these paragraphs you write a corresponding global function named:

         <ul class="code">
            Act1_2_4_6_3_13()

         </ul>

         Do not document these functions. After all, that's what the design document is
         for!

         <p>

         Since the design doc is auto-numbered, it will be extremely difficult to keep it
         up to date with changes in the code (because the function names, of course, are
         static, not auto-numbered.) This isn't a problem for you because you will not
         try to keep the document up to date.  In fact, do everything you can to destroy
         all traces of the document.

         <p>

         Those who come after you should only be able to find one or two contradictory,
         early drafts of the design document hidden on some dusty shelving in the back
         room near the dead 286 computers.
<p>
         <h4>Units of Measure</h4>

         Never document the units of measure of any variable, input, output or
         parameter. e.g. feet, metres, cartons. This is not so important in bean counting,
         but it is very important in engineering work. As a corollary, never document the
         units of measure of any conversion constants, or how the values were derived. It
         is mild cheating, but very effective, to salt the code with some incorrect units
         of measure in the comments. If you are feeling particularly malicious, make up
         your <b>own</b> unit of measure; name it after yourself or some obscure person
         and never define it. If somebody challenges you, tell them you did so that you
         could use integer rather than floating point arithmetic.
<p>
         <h4>Gotchas</h4>

         Never document gotchas in the code. If you suspect there may be a bug in a
         class, keep it to yourself. If you have ideas about how the code should be
         reorganised or rewritten, for heaven's sake, do not write them down. Remember
         the words of Thumper in the movie Bambi <i>&quot;If you can't say anything nice,
         don't say anything at all&quot;</i>. What if the programmer who wrote that code
         saw your comments? What if the owner of the company saw them? What if a customer
         did? You could get yourself fired. An anonymous comment that says &quot;This
         needs to be fixed!&quot; can do wonders, especially if it's not clear what the
         comment refers to.  Keep it vague, and nobody will feel personally criticised.
<p>
         <h4>Documenting Variables</h4>

         <b>Never</b> put a comment on a variable declaration. Facts about how the
         variable is used, its bounds, its legal values, its implied/displayed number of
         decimal points, its units of measure, its display format, its data entry rules (e.g.
         total fill, must enter), when its value can be trusted etc. should be gleaned
         from the procedural code. If your boss forces you to write comments, lard method
         bodies with them, but never comment a variable declaration, not even a temporary!
<p>
         <h4>Disparage In the Comments</h4>

         Discourage any attempt to use external maintenance contractors by peppering
         your code with insulting references to other leading software companies,
         especial anyone who might be contracted to do the work. e.g.:

         <ul class="code">
            <span class="comment">/* The optimised inner loop.

            <br>

            This stuff is too clever for the dullard at Software Services Inc., who would

            <br>

            probably use 50 times as memory &amp; time using the dumb routines in &lt;math.h&gt;.

            <br>

            */</span>

            <br>

            <font color="#000099">class</font> <b>clever_SSInc</b>

            <ul>

               <font size="+1">{</font>

               <br>

               <font color="#000099"><b>.</b></font><font color="#000099"><b>.</b></font><font color="#000099">
               <b>.</b></font>

               <br>

               <font size="+1">}</font>

            </ul>

         </ul>

         If possible, put insulting stuff in syntactically significant parts of the code,
         as well as just the comments so that management will probably break the code if
         they try to sanitise it before sending it out for maintenance.
<p>
         <h4>COMMENT AS IF IT WERE C&Oslash;B&Oslash;L ON PUNCH CARDS</h4>

         Always refuse to accept advances in the development environment arena,
         especially <!--a href="scid.html"-->SCIDs<!--/a-->. Disbelieve rumors that all function
         and variable declarations are never more than one click away and always assume
         that code developed in Visual Studio 6.0 will be maintained by someone using
         edlin or vi. Insist on Draconian commenting rules to bury the source code proper.
<p>
         <h4>Monty Python Comments</h4>

         On a method called <i>makeSnafucated</i> insert only the JavaDoc <span class="comment">/*
         make snafucated */</span>. Never define what <i>snafucated</i> means <b><i>anywhere</i></b>.
         Only a fool does not already know, with complete certainty, what <i>snafucated</i>
         means. For classic examples of this technique, consult the Sun AWT JavaDOC.

   <h2>Program Design</h2>
   <blockquote><i>
      The cardinal rule of writing unmaintainable code is to specify each fact in as
      many places as possible and in as many ways as possible.<br>
   </i>- Roedy Green</blockquote>
   <p>
   <ol>

         The key to writing maintainable code is to specify each fact about the
         application in only one place. To change your mind, you need change it in only
         one place, and you are guaranteed the entire program will still work. Therefore,
         the key to writing unmaintainable code is to specify a fact over and over, in as
         many places as possible, in as many variant ways as possible.  Happily,
         languages like Java go out of their way to make writing this sort of
         unmaintainable code easy. For example, it is almost impossible to change the
         type of a widely used variable because all the casts and conversion functions
         will no longer work, and the types of the associated temporary variables will no
         longer be appropriate. Further, if the variable is displayed on the screen, all
         the associated display and data entry code has to be tracked down and manually
         modified. The Algol family of languages which include C and Java treat storing
         data in an array, Hashtable, flat file and database with <b>totally</b>
         different syntax.  In languages like Abundance, and to some extent Smalltalk,
         the syntax is identical; just the declaration changes. Take advantage of Java's
         ineptitude.  Put data you know will grow too large for RAM, for now into an
         array. That way the maintenance programmer will have a horrendous task
         converting from array to file access later.  Similarly place tiny files in
         databases so the maintenance programmer can have the fun of converting them to
         array access when it comes time to performance tune.
<p>
         <h4>Java Casts</h4>

         Java's casting scheme is a gift from the Gods.  You can use it without guilt
         since the language requires it. Every time you retrieve an object from a
         Collection you must cast it back to its original type. Thus the type of the
         variable  may be specified in dozens of places.  If the type later changes, all
         the casts must be changed to match. The compiler may or may not detect if the
         hapless maintenance programmer fails to catch them all (or changes one too many).
         In a similar way, all matching casts to <span class="code">(short)</span> need
         to be changed to <span class="code">(int)</span> if the type of a variable
         changes from <span class="code">short</span> to <span class="code">int</span>.
         There is a movement afoot in invent a generic cast operator <span class="code">(cast)</span>
         and a generic conversion operator <span class="code">(convert)</span> that would
         require no maintenance when the type of variable changes.  Make sure this heresy
         never makes it into the language specification.  Vote no on <!--a href="jglossr.html#RFE"-->RFE<!--/a-->
         114691 and on genericity which would eliminate the need for many casts.
<p>
         <h4>Exploit Java's Redundancy</h4>

         Java insists you specify the type of every variable twice. Java programmers
         are so used to this redundancy they won't notice if you make the two types <i>slightly</i>
         different, as in this example:

         <ul class="code">
            Bubbleg<i>u</i>m <b>b</b> <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> <font color="#000099">new</font>
            Bubbleg<i>o</i>m();

         </ul>

         Unfortunately the popularity of the ++ operator makes it harder to get away with
         pseudo-redundant code like this:

         <ul class="code">
            swim<i>m</i>er <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> swim<i>n</i>er <font color="#000099">
            <b>+</b></font> 1;

         </ul>
<p>
         <h4>Never Validate</h4>

         Never check input data for any kind of correctness or discrepancies. It will
         demonstrate that you absolutely trust the company's equipment as well as that
         you are a perfect team player who trusts all project partners and system
         operators. Always return reasonable values even when data inputs are
         questionable or erroneous.
<p>
         <h4>Be polite, Never Assert</h4>

         Avoid the assert() mechanism, because it could turn a three-day debug fest
         into a ten minute one.
<p>
         <h4>Avoid Encapsulation</h4>

         In the interests of efficiency, avoid encapsulation. Callers of a method need
         all the external clues they can get to remind them how the method works inside.
<p>
         <h4>Clone &amp; Modify</h4>

         In the name of efficiency, use cut/paste/clone/modify. This works much faster
         than using many small reusable modules. This is especially useful   in shops
         that measure your progress by the number of lines of code you've written.
<p>
         <h4>Use Static Arrays</h4>

         If a module in a library needs an array to hold an image, just define a static
         array.  Nobody will ever have an image bigger than 512 x 512, so a fixed-size
         array is OK. For  best precision, make it an array of doubles.  Bonus effect for
         hiding a 2 Meg static array which causes the program to exceed the memory of the
         client's machine and thrash like crazy even if they never use your routine.
<p>
         <h4>Dummy Interfaces</h4>

         Write an empty interface called something like &quot;WrittenByMe&quot;, and
         make all of your classes implement it.  Then, write wrapper classes for any of
         Java's built-in classes that you use.  The idea is to make sure that every
         single object in your program implements this interface.  Finally, write all
         methods so that both their arguments and return types are WrittenByMe.  This
         makes it nearly impossible to figure out what some methods do, and introduces
         all sorts of entertaining casting requirements.  For a further extension, have
         each team member have his/her own personal interface (e.g., WrittenByJoe); any
         class worked on by a programmer gets to implement his/her interface.  You can
         then arbitrary refer to objects by any one of a large number of meaningless
         interfaces!
<p>
         <h4>Giant Listeners</h4>

         Never create separate Listeners for each Component. Always have one listener
         for every button in your project and simply use massive if...else statements to
         test for which button was pressed.
<p>
         <h4>Too Much Of A Good Thing<sup>TM</sup></h4>

         Go wild with encapsulation and oo. For example:

         <ul class="code">
            myPanel<font color="#000099"><b>.</b></font>add(
            getMyButton<b>(</b><b>)</b> );

            <br>

            <font color="#000099">private</font> JButton <b>getMyButton</b>()
            <ul>

               <font size="+1">{</font>

               <br>

               <font color="#000099">return</font> myButton;

               <br>

               <font size="+1">}</font>

            </ul>

         </ul>
         That one probably did not even seem funny. Don't worry. It will some day.
<p>
         <h4>Friendly Friend</h4>

         Use as often as possible the friend-declaration in C++. Combine this with
         handing the pointer of the creating class to a created class. Now you don't need
         to fritter away your time in thinking about interfaces. Additionally you should
         use the keywords <i>private</i> and <i>protected</i> to prove that your classes
         are well encapsulated.
<p>         <h4>Use Three Dimensional Arrays</h4>

          Lots of them. Move data between the arrays in convoluted ways, say, filling
         the columns in arrayB with the rows from arrayA. Doing it with an offset of 1,
         for no apparent reason, is a nice touch. Makes the maintenance programmer
         nervous.
<p>         <h4>Mix and Match</h4>

         Use both accessor methods and public variables. That way, you can change an
         object's variable without the overhead of calling the accessor, but still claim
         that the class is a &quot;Java Bean&quot;. This has the additional advantage of
         frustrating the maintenence programmer who adds a logging function to try to
         figure out who is changing the value.
<p>         <h4>Wrap, wrap, wrap</h4>

         Whenever you have to use methods in code you did not write, insulate your code
         from that other <i>dirty</i> code by at least one layer of wrapper. After all,
         the other author <b>might</b> some time in the future recklessly rename every
         method. Then where would you be? You could of course, if he did such a thing,
         insulate your code from the changes by writing a wrapper or you could let VAJ
         handle the global rename. However, this is the perfect excuse to preemptively
         cut him off at the pass with a wrapper layer of indirection, <b>before</b> he
         does anything idiotic. One of Java's main faults is that there is no way to
         solve many simple problems without dummy wrapper methods that do nothing but
         call another method of the same name, or a closely related name. This means it
         is possible to write wrappers four-levels deep that do absolutely nothing, and
         almost no one will notice. To maximise the obscuration, at each level, rename
         the methods, selecting random synonyms from a thesaurus. This gives the illusion
         something of note is happening. Further, the renaming helps ensure the lack of
         consistent project terminology. To ensure no one attempts to prune your levels
         back to a reasonable number, invoke some of your code bypassing the wrappers at
         each of the levels.
<p>         <h4>Wrap Wrap Wrap Some More</h4>

         Make sure all API functions are wrapped at least 6-8 times, with function
         definitions in separate source files.  Using #defines to make handy shortcuts to
         these functions also helps.
<p>         <h4>No Secrets!</h4>

         Declare every method and variable public. After all, somebody, sometime might
         want to use it. Once a method has been declared public, it can't very well be
         retracted, now can it? This makes it very difficult to later change the way
         anything works under the covers. It also has the delightful side effect of
         obscuring what a class is for. If the boss asks if you are out of your mind,
         tell him you are following the classic principles of transparent interfaces.
<p>         <h4>The Kama Sutra</h4>

         This technique has the added advantage of driving any users or documenters of
         the package to distraction as well as the maintenance programmers. Create a
         dozen overloaded variants of the same method that differ in only the most minute
         detail. I think it was Oscar Wilde who observed that positions 47 and 115 of the
         Kama Sutra were the same except in 115 the woman had her fingers crossed. Users
         of the package then have to carefully peruse the long list of methods to figure
         out just which variant to use. The technique also balloons the documentation and
         thus ensures it will more likely be out of date. If the boss asks why you are
         doing this, explain it is solely for the convenience of the users. Again for the
         full effect, clone any common logic and sit back and wait for it the copies to
         gradually get out of sync.
<p>         <h4>Permute and Baffle</h4>

         Reverse the parameters on a method called drawRectangle(height, width) to
         drawRectangle(width, height) without making any change whatsoever to the name of
         the method. Then a few releases later, reverse it back again. The maintenance
         programmers can't tell by quickly looking at any call if it has been adjusted
         yet. Generalisations are left as an exercise for the reader.
<p>         <h4>Theme and Variations</h4>

         Instead of using a parameter to a single method, create as many separate
         methods as you can. For example instead of <span class="code">setAlignment(int
         alignment)</span> where alignment is an enumerated constant, for left, right,
         center, create three methods<span class="code"> setLeftAlignment</span>, <span class="code">setRightAlignment</span>,
         and <span class="code">setCenterAlignment</span>. Of course, for the full effect,
         you must clone the common logic to make it hard to keep in sync.
<p>         <h4>Static Is Good</h4>

         Make as many of your variables as possible static. If <i>you</i> don't need
         more than one instance of the class in this program, no one else ever will
         either. Again, if other coders in the project complain, tell them about the
         execution speed improvement you're getting.
<p>         <h4>Cargill's Quandry</h4>

         Take advantage of Cargill's quandary (I think this was his) &quot;any design
         problem can be solved by adding an additional level of indirection, except for
         too many levels of indirection.&quot;  Decompose OO programs until it becomes
         nearly impossible to find a method which actually updates program state. Better
         yet, arrange all such occurrences to be activated as callbacks from by
         traversing pointer forests which are known to contain every function pointer
         used within the entire system. Arrange for the forest traversals to be activated
         as side-effects from releasing reference counted objects previously created via
         deep copies which aren't really all that deep.
<p>         <h4>Packratting</h4>

         Keep all of your unused and outdated methods and variables around in your code.
         After all - if you needed to use it once in 1976, who knows if you will want to
         use it again sometime? Sure the program's changed since then, but it might just
         as easily change back, you &quot;don't want to have to reinvent the wheel&quot;
         (supervisors love talk like that). If you have left the comments on those
         methods and variables untouched, and sufficiently cryptic, anyone maintaining
         the code will be too scared to touch them.
<p>         <h4>And That's Final</h4>

         Make all of your leaf classes final. After all, <i>you're</i> done with the
         project - certainly no one else could possibly improve on your work by extending
         your classes. And it might even be a security flaw - after all, isn't java.lang.String
         final for just this reason? If other coders in your project complain, tell them
         about the execution speed improvement you're getting.
<p>         <h4>Eschew The Interface</h4>

         In Java, disdain the interface. If your supervisors complain, tell them that
         Java interfaces force you to &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; code between different
         classes that implement the same interface the same way, and they <i>know</i> how
         hard that would be to maintain. Instead, do as the Java AWT designers did - put
         lots of functionality in your classes that can only be used by classes that
         inherit from them, and use lots of &quot;instanceof&quot; checks in your methods.
         This way, if someone wants to reuse your code, they have to extend your classes.
         If they want to reuse your code from two different classes - tough luck, they
         can't extend both of them at once! If an interface is unavoidable, make an all-purpose
         one and name it something like &quot;ImplementableIface.&quot; Another gem from
         academia is to append &quot;Impl&quot; to the names of classes that implement
         interfaces. This can be used to great advantage, e.g. with classes that
         implement Runnable.
<p>         <h4>Avoid Layouts</h4>

         Never use layouts. That way when the maintenance programmer adds one more
         field he will have to manually adjust the absolute co-ordinates of every other
         thing displayed on the screen. If your boss forces you to use a layout, use a
         single giant GridBagLayout, and hard code in absolute grid co-ordinates.
<p>         <h4>Environment variables</h4>

         If you have to write classes for some other programmer to use, put environment-checking
         code (getenv() in C++ / System.getProperty() in Java) in your classes' nameless
         static initializers, and pass all your arguments to the classes this way, rather
         than in the constructor methods. The advantage is that the initializer methods
         get called as soon as the class program binaries get <i>loaded</i>, even before
         any of the classes get instantiated, so they will usually get executed before
         the program main(). In other words, there will be no way for the rest of the
         program to modify these parameters before they get read into your classes - the
         users better have set up all their environment variables just the way you had
         them!
<p>         <h4>Table Driven Logic</h4>

         Eschew any form of table-driven logic. It starts out innocently enough, but
         soon leads to end users proofreading and then <i>shudder</i>, even modifying the
         tables for themselves.
<p>         <h4>Modify Mom's Fields</h4>

         In Java, all primitives passed as parameters are effectively read-only because
         they are passed by value. The callee can modify the parameters, but that has no
         effect on the caller's variables. In contrast all objects passed are read-write.
         The reference is passed by value, which means the object itself is effectively
         passed by reference. The callee can do whatever it wants to the fields in your
         object. Never document whether a method actually modifies the fields in each of
         the passed parameters. Name your methods to suggest they only look at the fields
         when they actually change them.
<p>        <h4>The Magic Of Global Variables</h4>

          Instead of using exceptions to handle error processing, have your error
         message routine set a global variable.  Then make sure that every long-running
         loop in the system checks this global flag and terminates if an error occurs.
         Add another global variable to signal when a user presses the 'reset' button. Of
         course all the major loops in the system also have to check this second flag.
         Hide a few loops that <b>don't</b> terminate on demand.
<p>         <h4>Globals, We Can't Stress These Enough!</h4>

          If God didn't want us to use global variables, he wouldn't have invented them.
         Rather than disappoint God, use and set as many global variables as possible.
         Each function should use and set at least two of them, even if there's no reason
         to do this. After all, any good maintenance programmer will soon figure out this
         is an exercise in detective work, and she'll be happy for the exercise that
         separates real maintenance programmers from the dabblers.
<p>         <h4>Globals, One More Time, Boys</h4>

         Global variables save you from having to specify arguments in functions. Take
         full advantage of this. Elect one or more of these global variables to specify
         what kinds of processes to do on the  others. Maintenance programmers foolishly
         assume that C functions will not have side effects.  Make sure they squirrel
         results and internal state information away in global variables.
<p>         <h4>Side Effects</h4>

         In C, functions are supposed to be <!--a href="jglossi.html#IDEMPOTENT"-->idempotent<!--/a-->,
         (without side effects).  I hope that hint is sufficient.
<p>         <h4>Backing Out</h4>

         Within the body of a loop, assume that the loop action is successful and
         immediately update all pointer variables. If an exception is later detected on
         that loop action, back out the pointer advancements as side effects of a
         conditional expression following the loop body.
<p>         <h4>Local Variables</h4>

         Never use local variables. Whenever you feel the temptation to use one, make
         it into an instance or static variable instead to unselfishly share it with all
         the other methods of the class. This will save you work later when other methods
         need similar declarations. C++ programmers can go a step further by making all
         variables global.
<p>         <h4>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </h4>

         If you have to define a structure to hold data for callbacks, always call the
         structure PRIVDATA.  Every module can define it's own PRIVDATA.  In VC++, this
         has the advantage of confusing the debugger so that if you have a PRIVDATA
         variable and try to expand it in the watch window, it doesn't know which
         PRIVDATA you mean, so it just picks one.
<p>         <h4>Configuration Files</h4>

         These usually have the form keyword=value.  The values are loaded into Java
         variables at load time. The most obvious obfuscation technique is to use
         slightly different names for the keywords and the Java variables. Use
         configuration files even for constants that never change at run time. Parameter
         file variables require at least five times as much code to maintain as a simple
         variable would.
<p>         <h4>Bloated classes</h4>

          To ensure your classes are bounded in the most obtuse way possible, make sure
         you include peripheral, obscure methods and attributes in every class.  For
         example, a class that defines astrophysical orbit geometry really should have a
         method that computes ocean tide schedules and attributes that comprise a Crane
         weather model.  Not only does this over-define the class, it makes finding these
         methods in the general system code like looking for a guitar pick in a landfill.
<p>         <h4>Subclass With Abandon</h4>

         Object oriented programming is a godsend for writing unmaintainable code.  If
         you have a class with 10 properties (member/method) in it, consider a base class
         with only one property and subclassing it 9 levels deep so that each descendant
         adds one property.  By the time you get to the last descendant class, you'll
         have all 10 properties.  If possible, put each class declaration in a separate
         file.  This has the added effect of bloating your INCLUDE or USES statements,
         and forces the maintainer to open that many more files in his or her editor.
         Make sure you create at least one instance of each subclass.

   <ol>
         <h4>Obfuscated C</h4>

         Follow the obfuscated C contests on the Internet and sit at the lotus feet of
         the masters.
<p>         <h4>Find a Forth or APL Guru</h4>

          In those worlds, the terser your code and the more bizarre the way it works,
         the more you are revered.
<p>         <h4>I'll Take a Dozen</h4>

         Never use one housekeeping variable when you could just as easily use two or
         three.
<p>         <h4>Jude the Obscure</h4>

         Always look for the most obscure way to do common tasks. For example, instead
         of using arrays to convert an integer to the corresponding string, use code like
         this:

         <ul class="code">
            char *p;

            <br>

            switch (n)

            <br>

            {

            <br>

            case 1:

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p = &quot;one&quot;;

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (0)

            <br>

            case 2:

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p = &quot;two&quot;;

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (0)

            <br>

            case 3:

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p = &quot;three&quot;;

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf(&quot;%s&quot;, p);

            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;

            <br>

            }

         </ul>
<p>         <h4>Foolish Consistency Is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds</h4>

         When you need a character constant, use many different formats  ' ', 32,
         0x20, 040. Make liberal use of the fact that 10 and 010 are not the same number
         in C or Java.
<p>         <h4>Casting</h4>

         Pass all data as a void * and then typecast to the appropriate structure.
         Using byte offsets into the data instead of structure casting is fun too.
<p>         <h4>The Nested Switch</h4>

         (a switch within a switch) is the most difficult type of nesting for the human
         mind to unravel.
<p>         <h4>Exploit Implicit Conversion</h4>

         Memorize all of the subtle implicit conversion rules in the programming
         language. Take full advantage of them. Never use a picture variable (in COBOL or
         PL/I) or a general conversion routine (such as sprintf in C). Be sure to use
         floating-point variables as indexes into arrays, characters as loop counters,
         and perform string functions on numbers. After all, all of these operations are
         well-defined and will only add to the terseness of your source code. Any
         maintainer who tries to understand them will be very grateful to you because
         they will have to read and learn the entire chapter on implicit data type
         conversion; a chapter that they probably had completely overlooked before
         working on your programs.
<p>         <h4>Raw ints</h4>

         When using ComboBoxes, use a switch statement with integer cases rather than
         named constants for the possible values.
<p>         <h4>Semicolons!</h4>

         Always use semicolons whenever they are syntactically allowed. For example:

         <ul class="code">
            <font color="#000099">if</font><font size="+1">(</font>a<font size="+1">)</font>;

            <br>

            <font color="#000099">else</font>;

            <ul>

               <font size="+1">{</font>

               <br>

               <font color="#000099">int</font> <b>d</b>;

               <br>

               d <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> c;

               <br>

               <font size="+1">}</font>

               <br>

               ;

            </ul>

         </ul>
        <h4>Use Octal</h4>

         Smuggle octal literals into a list of decimal numbers like this:

         <ul class="code">
            array <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> <font color="#000099">new</font> <font color="#000099">int</font>
            <font color="#000099"><b>[</b></font><font color="#000099"><b>]</b></font>

            <ul>

               <font size="+1">{</font>

               <br>

               111<font color="#000099"><b>,</b></font>

               <br>

               120<font color="#000099"><b>,</b></font>

               <br>

               <font color="red">013</font><font color="#000099"><b>,</b></font>

               <br>

               121<font color="#000099"><b>,</b></font>

               <br>

               <font size="+1">}</font>;

            </ul>

         </ul>
         <p><h4>Convert Indirectly</h4>

         Java offers great opportunity for obfuscation whenever you have to convert. As
         a simple example, if you have to convert a double to a String, go circuitously,
         via Double with <span class="code">new Double(d).toString()</span> rather than
         the more direct <span class="code">Double.toString(d)</span>. You can, of course,
         be far more circuitous than that! Avoid any conversion techniques recommended by
         the <!--a href="Converter.html"-->Conversion Amanuensis<!--/a-->. You get bonus points for
         every extra temporary object you leave littering the heap after your conversion.
<p>         <h4>Nesting</h4>

         Nest as deeply as you can. Good coders can get up to 10 levels of ( ) on a
         single line and 20 { } in a single method. C++ coders have the additional
         powerful option of preprocessor nesting totally independent of the nest
         structure of the underlying code. You earn extra Brownie points whenever the
         beginning and end of a block appear on separate pages in a printed listing.
         Wherever possible, convert nested ifs into nested [? ] ternaries. If they span
         several lines, so much the better.
<p>         <h4>Numeric Literals</h4>

          If you have an array with 100 elements in it, hard code the <!--a href="jglossl.html#LITERAL"-->literal<!--/a-->
         100 in as many places in the program as possible. Never use a static final named
         constant for the 100, or refer to it as <span class="code">myArray.length</span>.
         To make changing this constant even more difficult, use the literal 50 instead
         of 100/2, or 99 instead of 100-1. You can futher disguise the 100 by checking
         for <span class="code">a == 101</span> instead of <span class="code">a &gt; 100</span>
         or <span class="code">a &gt; 99</span> instead of <span class="code">a &gt;= 100</span>.

         <p>

         Consider things like page sizes, where the lines consisting of x header, y body,
         and z footer lines, you can apply the obfuscations independently to each of
         these <b>and</b> to their partial or total sums.

         <p>

         These time-honoured techniques are especially effective in a program with two
         unrelated arrays that just accidentally happen to both have 100 elements. If the
         maintenance programmer has to change the length of one of them, he will have to
         decipher every use of the literal 100 in the program to determine which array it
         applies to. He is almost sure to make at least one error, hopefully one that won't
         show up for years later.

         <p>There are even more fiendish variants. To lull the maintenance programmer
         into a false sense of security, dutifully create the named constant, but very
         occasionally <i>&quot;accidentally&quot;</i> use the literal 100 value instead
         of the named constant. Most fiendish of all, in place of the literal 100 or the
         correct named constant, sporadically use some other unrelated named constant
         that just accidentally happens to have the value 100, for now. It almost goes
         without saying that you should avoid any consistent naming scheme that would
         associate an array name with its size constant.
<p>         <h4>C's Eccentric View Of Arrays</h4>

         C compilers transform <span class="code">myArray[i]</span> into <span class="code">*(myArray
         + i)</span>, which is equivalent to <span class="code">*(i + myArray)</span>
         which is equivalent to <span class="code">i[myArray]</span>. Experts know to put
         this to good use.  To really disguise things, generate the index with a function:

         <p>

         <span class="code">int myfunc(int q, int p) { return p%q; }

         <br>

         ...

         <br>

         myfunc(6291, 8)[Array]; </span>

         <p>

         Unfortunately, these techniques can only be used in native C classes, not Java.
<p>         <h4>L o n g &nbsp;  L i n e s</h4>

         Try to pack as much as possible into a single line. This saves the overhead of
         temporary variables, and makes source files shorter by eliminating new line
         characters and white space. Tipremove all white space around operators. Good
         programmers can often hit the 255 character line length limit imposed by some
         editors. The bonus of long lines is that programmers who cannot read 6 point
         type must scroll to view them.
<p>         <h4>Exceptions</h4>

         I am going to let you in on a little-known coding secret. Exceptions are a
         pain in the behind. Properly-written code never fails, so exceptions are
         actually unnecessary. Don't waste time on them. Subclassing exceptions is for
         incompetents who know their code will fail. You can greatly simplify your
         program by having only a single try/catch in the entire application (in main)
         that calls System.exit(). Just stick a perfectly standard set of throws on every
         method header whether they could actually throw any exceptions or not.
<p>         <h4>When To Use Exceptions</h4>

         Use exceptions for non-exceptional conditions. Routinely terminate loops with
         an <span class="code">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>. Pass return
         standard results from a method in an exception.
<p>         <h4>Use threads With Abandon</h4>

         title says it all.
<p>         <h4>Lawyer Code</h4>

         Follow the language lawyer discussions in the newsgroups about what various
         bits of tricky code should do e.g. <span class="code">a=a++;</span> or <span class="code">f(a++,a++);</span>
         then sprinkle your code liberally with the examples.  In C, the effects of pre/post
         decrement code such as

         <ul class="code">
            *++b ? (*++b + *(b-1)) 0

         </ul>

         are not defined by the language spec.  Every compiler is free to evaluate in a
         different order.  This makes them doubly deadly. Similarly, take advantage of
         the complex tokenising rules of C and Java by removing all spaces.

<p>         <h4>Early Returns</h4>

         Rigidly follow the guidelines about no goto, no early returns, and no labelled
         breaks especially when you can increase the if/else nesting depth by at least 5
         levels.
<p>         <h4>Avoid {}</h4>

         Never put in any { } surrounding your if/else blocks unless they are
         syntactically obligatory. If you have a deeply nested mixture of if/else
         statements and blocks, especially with misleading indentation, you can trip up
         even an expert maintenance programmer. For best results with this technique, use
         Perl.  You can pepper the code with additional ifs <i>after</i> the statements,
         to amazing effect.
<p>         <h4>Tabs From Hell</h4>

         Never underestimate how much havoc you can create by indenting with tabs
         instead of spaces, especially when there is no corporate standard on how much
         indenting a tab represents. Embed tabs inside string literals, or use a tool to
         convert spaces to tabs that will do that for you.
<p>         <h4>Magic Matrix Locations</h4>

         Use special values in certain matrix locations as flags. A good choice is the
         [3][0] element in a transformation matrix used with a homogeneous coordinate
         system.
<p>         <h4>Magic Array Slots revisited</h4>

         If you need several variables of a given type, just define an array of them,
         then access them by number.  Pick a numbering convention that only you know and
         don't document it.  And don't bother to define #define constants for the indexes.
         Everybody should just know that the global variable widget[15] is the cancel
         button. This is just an up-to-date variant on using absolute numerical addresses
         in assembler code.
<p>         <h4>Never Beautify</h4>

         Never use an automated source code tidier (beautifier) to keep your code
         aligned. Lobby to have them banned them from your company on the grounds they
         create false deltas in PVCS/CVS (version control tracking) or that every
         programmer should have his own indenting style held forever sacrosanct for any
         module he wrote. Insist that other programmers observe those idiosyncratic
         conventions in &quot;his &quot; modules. Banning beautifiers is quite easy, even
         though they save the millions of keystrokes doing manual alignment and days
         wasted misinterpreting poorly aligned code. Just insist that everyone use the <b>same</b>
         tidied format, not just for storing in the common repository, but also while
         they are editing. This starts an RWAR and the boss, to keep the peace, will ban
         automated tidying. Without automated tidying, you are now free to <i>accidentally</i>
         misalign the code to give the optical illusion that bodies of loops and ifs are
         longer or shorter than they really are, or that else clauses match a different
         if than they really do. e.g.

         <ul class="code">
            <pre>if(a)
  if(b) x=y;
else x=z;</pre>

         </ul>
<p>         <h4>The Macro Preprocessor</h4>

         It offers great opportunities for obfuscation. The key technique is to nest
         macro expansions several layers deep so that you have to discover all the
         various parts in many different *.hpp files. Placing executable code into macros
         then including those macros in every *.cpp file (even those that never use those
         macros) will maximize the amount of recompilation necessary if ever that code
         changes.
<p>         <h4>Exploit Schizophrenia</h4>

         Java is schizophrenic about array declarations. You can do them the old C, way
         String x[], (which uses mixed pre-postfix notation) or the new way String[] x,
         which uses pure prefix notation. If you want to really confuse people, mix the
         notationse.g.

         <ul class="code">
            <font color="#000099">byte</font><font color="#000099"><b>[</b></font><font color="#000099">
            <b>]</b></font> rowvector<font color="#000099"><b>,</b></font> colvector<font color="#000099">
            <b>,</b></font> matrix<font color="#000099"><b>[</b></font><font color="#000099">
            <b>]</b></font>;

         </ul>

         which is equivalent to:

         <ul class="code">
            <font color="#000099">byte</font><font color="#000099"><b>[</b></font><font color="#000099">

<p>         <h4>Hide Error Recovery Code</h4>

         Use nesting to put the error recovery for a function call as far as possible
         away from the call. This simple example can be elaborated to 10 or 12 levels of
         nest:

         <ul class="code">
            <font color="#000099">if</font> <font size="+1">(</font> function_A<b>(</b><b>)</b>
            <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font><font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> OK <font size="+1">)</font>

            <ul>

               <font size="+1">{</font>

               <br>

               <font color="#000099">if</font> <font size="+1">(</font> function_B<b>(</b><b>)</b>
               <font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font><font color="#000099"><b>=</b></font> OK <font size="+1">)</font>

<p>         <h4>Pseudo C</h4>

         The real reason for <span class="code">#define</span> was to help programmers who
         are familiar with another programming language to switch to C. Maybe you will
         find declarations like <span class="code">#define begin { &quot; or &quot; #define
         end } </span> useful to write more interesting code.
<p>         <h4>Confounding Imports</h4>

         Keep the maintenance programmer guessing about what packages the methods you
         are using are in. Instead of:

         <ul class="code">
            <font color="#000099">import</font> MyPackage<font color="#000099"><b>.</b></font>Read;

            <br>

            <font color="#000099">import</font> MyPackage<font color="#000099"><b>.</b></font>Write;

         </ul>

         use:

         <ul class="code">
            <font color="#000099">import</font> Mypackage<font color="#000099"><b>.</b></font>
            <font color="#000099"><b>*</b></font>;

         </ul>

         Never fully qualify any method or class no matter how obscure.  Let the
         maintenance programmer guess which of the packages/classes it belongs to. Of
         course, inconsistency in when you fully qualify and how you do your imports
         helps most.
<p>         <h4>Toilet Tubing</h4>

         Never under any circumstances allow the code from more than one function or
         procedure to appear on the screen at once.  To achieve this with short routines,
         use the following handy tricks:

         <ul>
               Blank lines are generally used to separate logical blocks of code.  Each line is
               a logical block in and of itself.  Put blank lines between each line.
<p>               Never comment your code at the end of a line.  Put it on the line above. If you're
               forced to comment at the end of the line, pick the longest line of code in the
               entire file, add 10 spaces, and left-align all end-of-line comments to that
               column.
<p>               Comments at the top of procedures should use templates that are at least 15
               lines long and make liberal use of blank lines.  Here's a handy template:

               <br>

               <span class="comment">/*

               <br>

         </ul>

         The technique of putting so much redundant information in documentation almost
         guarantees it will soon go out of date, and will help befuddle maintenance
         programmers foolish enough to trust it.
   </ol>

   <h2>Testing</h2>

   <blockquote><i>

      <p>

      I don't need to test my programs.  I have an error-correcting modem.
   </i><br>- Om I. Baud</blockquote>
   Leaving bugs in your programs gives the maintenance programmer who comes along
   later something interesting to do. A well done bug should leave absolutely no
   clue as to when it was introduced or where.  The laziest way to accomplish this
   is simply never to test your code.

   <ol>
         <h4>Never Test</h4>

         Never test any code that handles the error cases, machine crashes, or OS
         glitches. Never check return codes from the OS. That code never gets executed
         anyway and slows down your test times. Besides, how can you possibly test your
         code to handle disk errors, file read errors, OS crashes, and all those sorts of
         events? Why, you would have to either an incredibly unreliable computer or a
         test scaffold that mimicked such a thing. Modern hardware never fails, and who
         wants to write code just for testing purposes? It isn't any fun. If users
         complain, just blame the OS or hardware. They'll never know.
<p>         <h4>Never, Ever Do Any Performance Testing</h4>

         Hey, if it isn't fast enough, just tell the customer to buy a faster machine.
         If you did do performance testing, you might find a bottleneck, which might lead
         to algorithm changes, which might lead to a complete redesign of your product.
         Who wants that? Besides, performance problems that crop up at the customer site
         mean a free trip for you to some exotic location.  Just keep your shots up-to-date
         and your passport handy.
<p>         <h4>Never Write Any Test Cases</h4>

         Never perform code coverage or path coverage testing. Automated testing is for
         wimps.  Figure out which features account for 90% of the uses of your routines,
         and allocate 90% of the tests to those paths. After all, this technique probably
         tests only about 60% of your source code, and you have just saved yourself 40%
         of the test effort. This can help you make up the schedule on the back-end of
         the project. You'll be long gone by the time anyone notices that all those nice &quot;marketing
         features&quot; don't work. The big, famous software companies test code this way;
         so should you. And if for some reason, you are still around, see the next item.
<p>         <h4>Testing is for cowards</h4>

          A brave coder will bypass that step.  Too many programmers are afraid of
         their boss, afraid of losing their job, afraid of customer hate mail and afraid
         of being sued.  This fear paralyzes action, and reduces productivity.  Studies
         have shown that eliminating the test phase means that managers can set ship
         dates well in advance, an obvious aid in the planning process.  With fear gone,
         innovation and experimentation can blossom.  The role of the programmer is to
         produce code, and debugging can be done by a cooperative effort on the part of
         the help desk and the legacy maintenance group.

         <p>

         If we have full confidence in our coding ability, then testing will be
         unnecessary. If we look at this logically, then any fool can recognise that
         testing does not even attempt to solve a technical problem, rather, this is a
         problem of emotional confidence.  A more efficient solution to this lack of
         confidence issue is to eliminate testing completely and send our programmers to
         self-esteem courses.  After all, if we choose to do testing, then we have to
         test every program change, but we only need to send the programmers to one
         course on building self-esteem.  The cost benefit is as amazing as it is obvious.
<p>         <h4>Ensuring It Only Works In Debug Mode</h4>

         If you've defined TESTING as 1

         <ul class="code">
            #define TESTING 1

         </ul>

         this gives you the wonderful opportunity to have separate code sections, such as

         <ul class="code">
            #if TESTING==1

            <br>

            #endif

         </ul>

         which can contain such indispensable tidbits as

         <ul class="code">
            x = rt_val;

         </ul>

         so that if anyone resets <span class="code">TESTING</span> to 0, the program won't
         work. And with the tiniest bit of imaginative work, it will not only befuddle
         the logic, but confound the compiler as well.

   </ol>

   <h2>Choice Of Language</h2>

   <blockquote><i>
      Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of
      language.
   </i><br>- Ludwig Wittgenstein</blockquote>
      <p>
   Computer languages are gradually evolving to become more fool proof.  Using
   state of the art languages is unmanly.  Insist on using the oldest language you
   can get away with, octal machine language if you can (Like Hans und Frans, I am
   no girlie man; I am so virile I used to code by plugging gold tipped wires into
   a plugboard of IBM unit record equipment (punch cards), or by poking holes in
   paper tape with a hand punch), failing that assembler, failing that FORTRAN or
   COBOL, failing that C, and BASIC, failing that C++.

   <ol>
         <h4>F&Oslash;RTRAN</h4>

         Write all your code in FORTRAN. If your boss ask why, you can reply that there
         are lots of very useful libraries that you can use thus saving time. However the
         chances of writing maintainable code in FORTRAN are zero, and therefore
         following the unmaintainable coding guidelines is a lot easier.
      <p>
         <h4>Avoid Ada</h4>

         About 20% of these techniques can't be used in Ada.  Refuse to use Ada. If
         your manager presses you, insist that no-one else uses it, and point out that it
         doesn't work with your large suite of tools like lint and plummer that work
         around C's failings.
      <p>
         <h4>Use ASM</h4>

         Convert all common utility functions into asm.
      <p>
         <h4>Use QBASIC</h4>

         Leave all important library functions written in QBASIC, then just write an
         asm wrapper to handle the large-&gt;medium memory model mapping.
      <p>
         <h4>Inline Assembler</h4>

         Sprinkle your code with bits of inline assembler just for fun.  Almost no one
         understands assembler anymore. Even a few lines of it can stop a maintenance
         programmer cold.
      <p>
         <h4>MASM call C</h4>

         If you have assembler modules which are called from C, try to call C back from
         the assembler as often as possible, even if it's only for a trivial purpose and
         make sure you make full use of the goto, bcc and other charming obfuscations of
         assembler.
      <p>
         <h4>Avoid Maintainability Tools</h4>
         Avoid coding in <!--a href="article.html"-->Abundance<!--/a-->, or using any of its
         principles kludged into other languages. It was <b><i>designed</i></b> from the
         ground up with the primary goal of making the maintenance programmer's job
         easier. Similarly avoid Eiffel or Ada since they were designed to catch bugs
         before a program goes into production.
   </ol>

   <h2>Dealing With Others</h2>

   <blockquote><i>

      <p>

      <i>Hell is other people. </i>
   </i><br>- Jean-Paul Sartre, No Exit, 1934</blockquote>
There are many hints sprinkled thoroughout the tips above on how to rattle
   maintenance programmers though frustration, and how to foil your boss's attempts
   to stop you from writing unmaintainable code, or even how to foment an RWAR that
   involves everyone on the topic of how code should be formatted in the repository.

   <ol>
      <h4>Your Boss Knows Best</h4>

         If your boss thinks that his or her 20 year old FORTRAN experience is an
         excellent guide to contemporary programming, rigidly follow all his or her
         recommendations. As a result, the boss will trust you. That may help you in your
         career. You will learn many new methods to obfuscate program code.
<p>
         <h4>Subvert The Help Desk</h4>

         One way to help ensure the code is full of bugs is to ensure the maintenance
         programmers never hear about them.  This requires subverting the help desk.
         Never answer the phone. Use an automated voice that says &quot;thank you for
         calling the helpline. To reach a real person press &quot;1&quot; or leave a
         voice mail wait for the tone&quot;. Email help requests should be ignored other
         than to assign them a tracking number. The standard response to any problem is &quot;
         I think your account is locked out.  The person able to authorise reinstatement
         is not available just now.&quot;
<p>
         <h4>Keep Your Mouth Shut</h4>

         Be never vigilant of the next Y2K. If you ever spot something that could sneak
         up on a fixed deadline and destroy all life in the western hemisphere then <b>do
         not</b> openly discuss it until we are under the critical 4 year  event window
         of panic and opportunity. Do not tell friends, coworkers, or other competent
         people of your discovery. Under no circumstances attempt to publish anything
         that might hint at this new and tremendously profitable threat. Do send one
         normal priority, jargon encrypted, memo to upper management to cover-your-a$$.
         If at all possible attach the jargon encrypted information as a rider on an
         otherwise unrelated plain-text memo pertaining to a more immediately pressing
         business concern. Rest assured that we all see the threat too. Sleep sound at
         night knowing that long after you've been forced into early retirement you will
         be begged to come back at a logarithmically increased hourly rate!
<p>
         <h4>Baffle 'Em With Bullshit</h4>

         Subtlety is a wonderful thing, although sometimes a sledge-hammer is more
         subtle than other tools. So, a refinement on misleading comments create
         classes with names like <span class="code">FooFactory</span> containing comments
         with references to the GoF creational patterns (ideally with http links to bogus
         UML design documents) that have nothing to do with object creation.  Play off
         the maintainer's delusions of competence. More subtly, create Java classes with
         protected constructors and methods like <span class="code">Foo f = Foo.newInstance()</span>that
         return actual <b>new instances</b>, rather than the expected singleton. The
         opportunities for side-effects are endless.
<p>
         <h4>Book Of The Month Club</h4>

         Join a computer book of the month club. Select authors who appear to be too
         busy writing books to have had any time to actually write any code themselves.
         Browse the local bookstore for titles with lots of cloud diagrams in them and no
         coding examples. Skim these books to learn obscure pedantic words you can use to
         intimidate the whippersnappers that come after you. Your code should impress. If
         people can't understand your vocabulary, they must assume that you are very
         intelligent and that your algorithms are very deep. Avoid any sort of homely
         analogies in your algorithm explanations.
   </ol>

   <h2>Roll Your Own</h2>

   You've always wanted to write system level code. Now is your chance. Ignore the
   standard libraries and <a href="http://www.roll-your-own.com">write your own</a>. It will look great on your resum&eacute;.
   <ol>
      <h4>Roll Your Own BNF</h4>
         Always document your command syntax with your own, unique, undocumented brand
         of BNF notation. Never explain the syntax by providing a suite of annotated
         sample valid and invalid commands. That would demonstrate a complete lack of
         academic rigour. Railway diagrams are almost as gauche. Make sure there is no
         obvious way of telling a terminal symbol (something you would actually type)
         from an intermediate one -- something that represents a phrase in the syntax.
         Never use typeface, colour, caps, or any other visual clues to help the reader
         distinguish the two. Use the exact same punctuation glyphs in your BNF notation
         that you use in the command language itself, so the reader can never tell if a (...),
         [...], {...} or &quot;...&quot; is something you actually type as part of the
         command, or is intended to give clues about which syntax elements are obligatory,
         repeatable or optional in your BNF notation. After all, if they are too stupid
         to figure out your variant of BNF, they have no business using your program.
<p>         <h4>Roll Your Own Allocator</h4>

         Everyone knows that debugging your dynamic storage is complicated and time
         consuming.  Instead of making sure each class has no storage leaks, reinvent
         your own storage allocator. It just mallocs space out of a big arena.  Instead
         of freeing  storage, force your users to periodically perform a system reset
         that clears the heap.  There's only a few things the system needs to keep track
         of across resets -- lots easier than plugging all the storage leaks; and so long
         as the users remember to periodically reset the system, they'll  never run out
         of heap space.  Imagine them trying to change this strategy once deployed!

            ReadChars = .ReadChars (29,0)

            <br>

         <h4>Delphi/Pascal Only</h4>

         Don't use functions and procedures. Use the label/goto statements then jump
         around a lot inside your code using this. It'll drive 'em mad trying to trace
         through this. Another idea, is just to use this for the hang of it and scramble
         your code up jumping to and fro in some haphazard fashion.

            (lambda (*&lt;8-]= *&lt;8-[= ) (or *&lt;8-]= *&lt;8-[= ))

            <br>

            (not(null '(lambda(!)(if(&lt; 1 !)t nil)))))1(* !(!(1- !)))))

      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Visual Foxpro </h4>

         This one is specific to Visual Foxpro.  A variable is undefined and can't be
         used unless you assign a value to it.  This is what happens when you check a
         variable's type:

         <ul class="code">
            lcx = TYPE('somevariable')

         </ul>

         The value of lcx will be 'U' or undefined.  BUT if you assign scope to the
         variable it sort of defines it and makes it a logical FALSE.  Neat, huh!?

         <ul class="code">
            LOCAL lcx

            <br>

            lcx = TYPE('somevariable')

         </ul>

         The value of lcx is now 'L' or logical.  It is further defined the value of
         FALSE.  Just imagine the power of this in writing unmaintainable code.

         <ul class="code">
            LOCAL lc_one, lc_two, lc_three...  , lc_n

            <p>

         <h4>Don't Recompile</h4>

         Let's start off with probably the most fiendish technique ever devised:
         Compile the code to an executable. If it works, then just make one or two small
         little changes in the source code...in each module. <b>But don't bother
         recompiling these.</b> You can do that later when you have more time, and when
         there's time for debugging. When the hapless maintenance programmer years later
         makes a change and the code no longer works, she will erroneously assume it must
         be something she recently changed. You will send her off on a wild goose chase
         that will keep her busy for weeks.
<p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <h4>Foiling Debuggers</h4>

         A very simple way to confound people trying to understand your code by tracing
         it with a line debugger, is to make the lines long. In particular, put the then
         clause on the same line as the if.  They can't place breakpoints.  They can't
         tell which branch of an if was taken.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>S.I. vs American Measure</h4>

         In engineering work there are two ways to code. One is to convert all inputs
         to S.I. (metric) units of measure, then do your calculations then convert back
         to various civil units of measure for output. The other is to maintain the
         various mixed measure systems throughout. Always choose the second. It's the
         American way!
      <p></li>

      <li>
         <h4>CANI</h4>

          <b>C</b>onstant <b>A</b>nd <b>N</b>ever-ending <b>I</b>mprovement. Make &quot;improvements&quot;
         to your code often, and force users to upgrade often - after all, no one wants
         to be running an outdated version. Just because they think they're happy with
         the program as it is, just think how much happier they will be after you've &quot;fixed&quot;
         it! Don't tell anyone what the differences between versions are unless you are
         forced to - after all, why tell someone about bugs in the old version they might
         never have noticed otherwise?
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>About Box</h4>

         The About Box should contain only the name of the program, the names of the
         coders and a copyright notice written in legalese. Ideally it should link to
         several megs of code that produce an entertaining animated display. However, it
         should <b>never</b> contain a description of what the program is for, its minor
         version number, or the date of the most recent code revision, or the website
         where to get the updates, or the author's email address. This way all the users
         will soon all be running on different versions, and will attempt to install
         version N+2 before installing version N+1.
   <p>   </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Ch ch ch Changes</h4>

         The more changes you can make between versions the better, you don't want
         users to become bored with the same old API or user interface year after year.
         Finally, if you can make this change without the users noticing, this is better
         still - it will keep them on their toes, and keep them from becoming complacent.
      <p></li>

      <li>
         <h4>Put C Prototypes In Individual Files</h4>

         instead of common headers. This has the dual advantage of requiring a change
         in parameter data type to be maintained in every file, <b>and</b> avoids any
         chance that the compiler or linker will detect type mismatches. This will be
         especially helpful when porting from 32 -&gt; 64 bit platforms.
      <p></li>

      <li>
         <h4>No Skill Required</h4>

         You don't need great skill to write unmaintainable code. Just leap in and
         start coding. Keep in mind that management still measures productivity in lines
         of code even if you have to delete most of it later.
      <p></li>

      <li>
         <h4>Carry Only One Hammer</h4>

         Stick with what you know and travel light; if you only carry a hammer then all
         problems are nails.
      <p></li>

      <li>
         <h4>Standards Schmandards</h4>

         Whenever possible ignore the coding standards currently in use by thousands of
         developers in your project's target language and environment. For example insist
         on STL style coding standards when writing an MFC based application.
      <p></li>

      <li>
         <h4>Reverse the Usual True False Convention</h4>

         Reverse the usual definitions of true and false.  Sounds very obvious but it
         works great. You can hide:

         <ul class="code">
            #define TRUE 0

            <br>

            #define FALSE 1

         </ul>

         somewhere deep in the code so that it is dredged up from the bowels of the
         program from some file that noone ever looks at anymore. Then force the program
         to do comparisons like:

         <ul class="code">
            if ( var == TRUE )

         </ul>

         <ul class="code">
            if ( var != FALSE )

         </ul>

         someone is bound to  &quot;correct&quot; the apparent redundancy, and use var
         elsewhere in the usual way:

         <ul class="code">
            if ( var )

         </ul>

         Another technique is to make <span class="code">TRUE</span> and <span class="code">FALSE</span>
         have the same value, though most would consider that out and out cheating. Using
         values 1 and 2 or -1 and 0 is a more subtle way to trip people up and still look
         respectable. You can use this same technique in Java by defining a static
         constant called <span class="code">TRUE</span>. Programmers might be more
         suspicious you are up to no good since there is a built-in literal <span class="code">true</span>
         in Java.
 <p>     </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Third Party Libraries</h4>

         Include powerful third party libraries in your project and then don't use them.
         With practice you can remain completely ignorant of good tools and add the
         unused tools to your resum&eacute; in your &quot;Other Tools&quot; section.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Avoid Libraries</h4>

         Feign ignorance of libraries that are directly included with your development
         tool. If coding in Visual C++ ignore the presence of MFC or the STL and code all
         character strings and arrays by hand; this helps keep your pointer skills sharp
         and it automatically foils any attempts to extend the code.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Create a Build Order</h4>

         Make it so elaborate that no maintainer could ever get any of his or her fixes
         to compile. Keep secret <!--a href="jglosss.html#SMARTJ"-->SmartJ<!--/a--> which renders <span class="code">make</span>
         scripts almost obsolete. Similarly, keep secret that the <span class="code">javac</span>
         compiler is also available as a class. On pain of death, never reveal how easy
         it is to write and maintain a speedy little custom java program to find the
         files and do the make that directly invokes the <span class="code">sun.tools.javac.Main</span>
         compile class.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>More Fun With Make</h4>

         Have the makefile-generated-batch-file copy source files from multiple
         directories with undocumented overrwrite rules. This permits code branching
         without the need for any fancy source code control system, and stops your
         successors ever finding out which version of DoUsefulWork() is the one they
         should edit.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Collect Coding Standards</h4>

         Find all the tips you can on writing maintainable code such as  the <a href="http://www.squarebox.co.uk/javatips.html" target="_blank">Square
         Box Suggestions</a> and flagrantly violate them.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>IDE, Not Me!</h4>

          Put all the code in the makefileyour successors will be really impressed
         how you managed to write a makefile which generates a batch file that generates
         some header files and then builds the app, such that they can never tell what
         effects a change will have, or be able to migrate to a modern IDE. For maximum
         effect use an obsolete make tool, such as an early brain dead version of NMAKE
         without the notion of dependencies.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Bypassing Company Coding Standards</h4>

         Some companies have a strict policy of no numeric literals; you must use named
         constants. It is fairly easy to foil the intent of this policy. For example, one
         clever C++ programmer wrote:

         <ul class="code">
            #define K_ONE 1

            <br>

            #define K_TWO 2

            <br>

            #define K_THOUSAND 999

         </ul>

<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Compiler Warnings</h4>

         Be sure to leave in some compiler warnings. Use the handy &quot;-&quot; prefix
         in make to suppress the failure of the make due to any and all compiler errors.
         This way, if a maintenance programmer carelessly inserts an error into your
         source code, the make tool will nonetheless try to rebuild the entire package;
         it might even succeed!  And any programmer who compiles your code by hand will
         think that they have broken some existing code or header when all that has
         really happened is that they have stumbled across your harmless warnings. They
         will again be grateful to you for the enjoyment of the process that they will
         have to follow to find out that the error was there all along.  Extra bonus
         points make sure that your program cannot possibly compile with any of the
         compiler error checking diagnostics enabled. Sure, the compiler may be able to
         do subscripts bounds checking, but real programmers don't use this feature, and
         neither should you. Why let the compiler check for errors when you can use your
         own lucrative and rewarding time to find these subtle bugs?
      </li>

<p>      <li>
         <h4>Combine Bug Fixes With Upgrades</h4>

         Never put out a &quot;bug fix only&quot; release. Be sure to combine bug fixes
         with database format changes, complex user interface changes, and complete
         rewrites of the administration interfaces. That way, it will be so hard to
         upgrade that people will get used to the bugs and start calling them features.
         And the people that really want these &quot;features&quot; to work differently
         will have an incentive to upgrade to the new versions.  This will save you
         maintenance work in the long run, and get you more revenue from your customers.
      </li>

<p>      <li>
         <h4>Change File Formats With Each Release Of Your Product</h4>

         Yeah, your customers will demand upwards compatibility, so go ahead and do
         that. But make sure that there is no backwards compatibility. That will prevent
         customers from backing out the newer release, and coupled with a sensible bug
         fix policy (see above), will guarantee that once on a newer release, they will
         stay there. Extra bonus points Figure out how to get the old version to not
         even recognise files created by the newer versions. That way, they not only can't
         read them, they will deny that they are even created by the same application!
         Hint PC word processors provide a useful example of this sophisticated
         behaviour.
      </li>

<p>      <li>
         <h4>Compensate For Bugs</h4>

         Don't worry about finding the root cause of bugs in the code. Simply put in
         compensating code in the higher-level routines. This is a great intellectual
         exercise, akin to 3D chess, and will keep future code maintainers entertained
         for hours as they try to figure out whether the problem is in the low-level
         routines that generate the data or in the high-level routines that change
         various cases all around.  This technique is great for compilers, which are
         inherently multi-pass programs. You can completely avoid fixing problems in the
         early passes by simply making the later passes more complicated. With luck, you
         will never have to speak to the little snot who supposedly maintains the front-end
         of the compiler. Extra bonus points make sure the back-end breaks if the front-end
         ever generates the correct data.
      </li>

<p>      <li>
         <h4>Use Spin Locks</h4>

         Avoid actual synchronization primitives in favor of a variety of spin locks --
         repeatedly sleep then test a (non-volatile) global variable until it meets your
         criterion.  Spin locks are much easier to use and more &quot;general&quot; and &quot;flexible
         &quot; than the system objects.
      </li>

<p>      <li>
         <h4>Sprinkle sync code liberally</h4>

         Sprinkle some system synchronization primitives in places where they are <b>not</b>
         needed.  I came across one critical section in a section of code where there was
         no possibility of a second thread.  I challenged the original developer and he
         indicated that it helped document that the code was, well, &quot;critical!&quot;
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Graceful Degradation</h4>

         If your system includes an NT device driver, require the application to malloc
         I/O buffers and lock them in memory for the duration of any transactions, and
         free/unlock them after.  This will result in an application that crashes NT if
         prematurely terminated with that buffer locked. But nobody at the client site
         likely will be able to change the device driver, so they won't have a choice.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Custom Script Language</h4>

         Incorporate a scripting command language into your client/server apps that is
         byte compiled at runtime.

         <h4>Compiler Dependent Code</h4>

         If you discover a bug in your compiler or interpreter, be sure to make that
         behaviour essential for your code to work properly.  After all you don't use
         another compiler, and neither should anyone else!

         <h4>A Real Life Example</h4>

         Here's a real life example written by a master.  Let's look at all the
         different techniques he packed into this single C function.

         <ul class="code">
            void* Realocate(void*buf, int os, int ns)

            <br>

            {

            <ul>

               void*temp;

               <br>

               temp = malloc(os);

               <br>

               memcpy((void*)temp, (void*)buf, os);

               <br>

               free(buf);

               <br>

               buf = malloc(ns);

               <br>

               memset(buf, 0, ns);

               <br>

               memcpy((void*)buf, (void*)temp, ns);

               <br>

               return buf;

            </ul>

            }

         </ul>

         <ul>

            <li>
               Reinvent simple functions which are part of the standard libraries.
            </li>

            <li>
               The word <i>Realocate</i> is not spelled correctly.  Never underestimate the
               power of creative spelling.
            </li>

            <li>
               Make a temporary copy of input buffer for no real reason.
            </li>

            <li>
               Cast things for no reason.  memcpy() takes (void*), so cast our pointers even
               though they're already (void*).  Bonus for the fact that you could pass anything
               anyway.
            </li>

            <li>
               Never bothered to free temp. This will cause a slow memory leak, that may not
               show up until the program has been running for days.
            </li>

            <li>
               Copy more than necessary from the buffer just in case.  This will only cause a
               core dump on Unix, not Windows.
            </li>

            <li>
               It should be obvious that os and ns stand for &quot;old size&quot; and &quot;new
               size&quot;.
            </li>

            <li>
               After allocating buf, memset it to 0.  Don't use calloc() because somebody might
               rewrite the ANSI spec so that calloc() fills the buffer with something other
               than 0.  (Never mind the fact that we're about to copy exactly the same amount
               of data into buf.)
            </li>

         </ul>

<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>How To Fix Unused Variable Errors</h4>

         If your compiler issues &quot;unused local variable&quot; warnings, don't get
         rid of the variable. Instead, just find a clever way to use it.  My favorite is...

         <br>

         <span class="code">i = i; </span>
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>It's The Size That Counts</h4>

         It almost goes without saying that the larger a function is, the better it is.
         And the more jumps and GOTOs the better. That way, any change must be analysed
         through many scenarios. It snarls the maintenance programmer in the
         spaghettiness of it all. And if the function is truly gargantuan, it becomes the
         Godzilla of the maintenance programmers, stomping them mercilessly to the ground
         before they have an idea of what's happened.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>A Picture is a 1000 Words; A Function is 1000 Lines</h4>

         Make the body of every method as long as possible - hopefully you never write
         any methods or functions with fewer than a thousand lines of code, deeply nested,
         of course.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>One Missing File</h4>

         Make sure that one or more critical files is missing. This is best done with
         includes of includes. For example, in your main module, you have

         <ul class="code">
            #include &lt;stdcode.h&gt;

         </ul>

         Stdcode.h is available. But in stdcode.h, there's a reference to

         <ul class="code">
            #include &quot;a:\\refcode.h&quot;

         </ul>

         and refcode.h is no where to be found.
<p>      </li>

      <li>
         <h4>Write Everywhere, Read Nowhere</h4>

         At least one variable should be set everywhere and used almost nowhere.
         Unfortunately, modern compilers usually stop you from doing the reverse, read
         everywhere, write nowhere, but you can still do it in C or C++.
      </li>

   </ol>

   <h2>Philosophy</h2>

   <p>

   The people who design languages are the people who write the compilers and
   system classes. Quite naturally they design to make their work easy and
   mathematically elegant. However, there are 10,000 maintenance programmers to
   every compiler writer. The grunt maintenance programmers have absolutely no say
   in the design of languages. Yet the total amount of code they write dwarfs the
   code in the compilers.

   <p>

   An example of the result of this sort of elitist thinking is the JDBC interface.
   It makes life easy for the JDBC implementor, but a nightmare for the maintenance
   programmer. It is far <b>clumsier</b> than the FORTRAN interface that came out
   with SQL three decades ago.

   <p>

   Maintenance programmers, if somebody ever consulted them, would demand ways to
   hide the housekeeping details so they could see the forest for the trees. They
   would demand all sorts of shortcuts so they would not have to type so much and
   so they could see more of the program at once on the screen. They would complain
   loudly about the myriad petty time-wasting tasks the compilers demand of them.

   <p>

   There are some efforts in this direction <a href="http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/netrexx/" target="_blank">NetRexx</a>,
   <!--a href="bali.html"-->Bali<!--/a-->, and visual editors (e.g. IBM's Visual Age is a
   start) that can collapse detail irrelevant to the current purpose.

   <p>

   <h2>The Shoemaker Has No Shoes</h2>

   <p>

   Imagine having an accountant as a client who insisted on maintaining his general
   ledgers using a word processor. You would do you best to persuade him that his
   data should be structured. He needs validation with cross field checks. You
   would persuade him he could do so much more with that data when stored in a
   database, including controlled simultaneous update.

   <p>

   Imagine taking on a software developer as a client. He insists on maintaining
   all his data (source code) with a text editor. He is not yet even exploiting the
   word processor's colour, type size or fonts.

   <p>

   Think of what might happen if we started storing source code as structured data.
   We could view the <b>same</b> source code in many alternate ways, e.g. as Java,
   as NextRex, as a decision table, as a flow chart, as a loop structure skeleton (with
   the detail stripped off), as Java with various levels of detail or comments
   removed, as Java with highlights on the variables and method invocations of
   current interest, or as Java with generated comments about argument names and/or
   types. We could display complex arithmetic expressions in 2D, the way TeX and
   mathematicians do. You could see code with additional or fewer parentheses, (depending
   on how comfortable you feel with the precedence rules).
   Parenthesis nests could use varying size and colour to help matching by eye.
   With changes as transparent overlay sets that you can optionally remove or apply,
   you could watch in real time as other programmers on your team, working in a
   different country, modified code in classes that you were working on too.

   <p>

   You could use the full colour abilities of the modern screen to give subliminal
   clues, e.g. by automatically assigning a portion of the spectrum to each package/class
   using a pastel shades as the backgrounds to any references to methods or
   variables of that class. You could bold face the definition of any identifier to
   make it stand out.

   <p>

   You could ask what methods/constructors will produce an object of type X? What
   methods will accept an object of type X as a parameter? What variables are
   accessible in this point in the code? By clicking on a method invocation or
   variable reference, you could see its definition, helping sort out which version
   of a given method will actually be invoked. You could ask to globally visit all
   references to a given method or variable, and tick them off once each was dealt
   with. You could do quite a bit of code writing by point and click.

   <p>

   Some of these ideas would not pan out. But the best way to find out which would
   be valuable in practice is to try them. Once we had the basic tool, we could
   experiment with hundreds of similar ideas to make life easier for the
   maintenance programmer.

   An early version of this article appeared in Java Developers' Journal (volume 2
   issue 6). I also spoke on this topic in 1997 November  at the <a href="http://www.SoftwareSummit.com"  target="_blank">Colorado
   Summit Conference</a>. It has been gradually growing ever since.

   <p class="important">This essay is a <b>joke</b>! I apologise if anyone took
   this literally. Canadians think it gauche to label jokes with a :-). People paid
   no attention when I harped about how to write __maintainable code. I found people
   were more receptive hearing all the goofy things people often do to muck it up.
   Checking for <b>un</b>maintainable design patterns is a rapid way to defend
   against malicious or inadvertent sloppiness.</p>
